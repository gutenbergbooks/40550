<p>¶ He who aspires to master the art of expression must first of
all consecrate himself completely to some great cause and the
greatest cause of all is the cause of humanity. He must learn
to feel deeply and think clearly, to express himself eloquently.
He must be absolutely true to the best there is in him, if he has
to stand alone.</p>

<p>¶ Such natural powers as he may have should be cultivated
by the study of history, science and literature. He must not only
keep close to the people but remember that he is one of them,
and not above the meanest. He must feel the wrongs of others
so keenly that he forgets his own, and resolve to combat these
wrongs with all the power at his command.</p>

<p>¶ The most thrilling, inspiring oratory, the most powerful and
impressive eloquence is the voice of the disinherited, the oppressed,
the suffering and submerged; it is the voice of poverty and misery,
of rags and crusts, of wretchedness and despair; the voice of
humanity crying to the infinite; the voice that resounds throughout
the earth and reaches Heaven; the voice that awakens the conscience
of a race and proclaims the truths that fill the world with
life and liberty and love.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page_5" title="pg 5"></a>
FOREWORD</h2>

<p>Every generation has added a little to the store of truth of which the
human race has possessed itself throughout the long sweep of the
centuries. Every truth expressed and preserved by those who lived in
the past, is a contribution which enriches the lives of those who live in the
present. We, as members of the human race, are not separate atoms independent
of the universe, but we are atoms of it. We are the product of all
time, and partake of the truth of all preceding generations, in which the
power to express ideas and preserve them has existed.</p>

<p>One reason why the race has not profited more largely by the discoveries
of previous generations, is the fact that we feel so profoundly the discovery
of a truth of any nature, that we are prone to dogmatize it by a rule or set
of rules.
</p>

<p>This usually results in shutting away from us the real principle of which
the rule is but an evidence. A mechanic may learn every detail of every
rule for the construction of a steam engine, but if he lacks the understanding
of the principles which give rise to the rules, they will avail nothing and his
work must fail. If, however, he understands the principles involved, his work
will stand the test, though he has no knowledge of rules as such.
</p>

<p>In teaching the English language, the rules have been stressed, while
the principles have been submerged, so that the teaching of rules has not
resulted in the improvement of the student.
</p>

<p>The People's College, realizing this, has, through the author of this work,
revolutionized the teaching of the fundamental principles that underlie the
use of language. The stress is laid upon principles instead of rules, so that
the student, whether he remember a rule or not, will never forget the application
of these principles to the use of the written and spoken word.
</p>

<p>The assertion is ventured that no more practical and effective method
can be devised for the rapid and thorough teaching of these principles. Moreover,
the importance of this new departure in method cannot be over-estimated,
when we consider that only through the use of language can information
be disseminated concerning other branches of learning. This science,
then, lies at the very base of all real education, and a mastery of it puts the
student in possession of the only weapon by means of which he may master
all other sciences.
</p>

<p>The author has, with peculiar aptitude, grasped the fundamental character
of the foregoing facts and has adapted the study of language to the
real principles involved. All the dry rules that are the witnesses of principles
in the ordinary text are done away, while the principles evidenced by
those rules come forth to the light in practical application, with a beauty of
expression and a real utility that render the mastery of the subject an entertaining
excursion into the realms of learning, rather than a dry imprisonment
of the faculties in an effort to memorize misunderstood rules without
apparent reason or real use.
</p>

<p>It is the principle behind the rule that has power in it. When this is
understood, the method pursued by the author in this course will be universally
applied to all branches of learning, and will end forever the imprisonment
of children for the useless worship of rules.
</p>

<p>The author's grasp of this fact and the exemplification of it, contained
in this work are even more far-reaching than the foregoing would indicate.
It really means the application of a new viewpoint to life itself. It means
the questioning of the utility of authority; the questioning of the utility of
institutions; the application, we might say, of such a test as this: Does any
rule, does any authority, does any principle, conserve the interests of humanity?
If not, away with it. This means rationalism, the use of common
sense. It means that at last the race is beginning to consciously direct its
own destiny.
</p>

<p>It is with a profound sense of the necessity of education as a part of the
evolutionary process now in the conscious grasp of the race, and with a
conviction of the fundamental importance of the new viewpoint so ably presented
by the author that we dedicate this work "To the Education of the
Workers by the Workers."</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>Lesson I</h2>

<h4>Open Letter</h4>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>You are beginning a course of study in the use of Plain English.
We do not know what your previous study may have been, but the object
of this course is to give the basic principles and practice of the use of the
English Language for the benefit of those who have not had the opportunity
of a high school education and possibly have not finished in the
grade school.
</p>

<p>For this reason we have avoided, as much as possible, the statement
of rules and formulas to be learned by rote and have made the few rules
which it is necessary to know, grow naturally out of the need for them in
the development of expression in language.
</p>

<p>We have taken for granted several things in the preparation of
this course. First, we assume that you have never studied grammar,
or if you have, that you will be glad to review it in simplified form.
This course does not follow the lines laid down by technical grammarians.
It has been worked out on the basis of plain, common sense. Our
purpose is not to make of you a grammarian, versed in the knowledge
of rules and reasons, but to give you the power to express yourself more
readily, fluently and correctly&mdash;in other words to speak and write <i>good</i>
English.
</p>

<p>Second, we assume that you are interested and willing to work and
eager to increase your store of knowledge. Your progress in this branch
of knowledge will depend, to a large extent, upon your own efforts.
We have endeavored to avoid unnecessary and uninteresting rules and
make the course as simple, clear and plain as possible; but that does not
mean you will not have to work in order to master this study. We trust
it will be pleasant and interesting work, bringing you joy as it brings you
a growing sense of power.
</p>

<p>Probably no two people will use the same plan of work. Your
<a class="pagenum" id="page_10" title="pg 10"></a>
work, to be a pleasure, must express your own individuality. However,
we want to make a few suggestions which we know from experience
you will find helpful.
</p>

<p><b>1st.</b> <b>Be Systematic.</b> Find some time each day which you can
regularly spend in study. Do not be discouraged if it is only fifteen
minutes each day. The student who will spend fifteen minutes every
day regularly in intensive study can easily complete this course within
the prescribed time.
</p>

<p><b>2d.</b> <b>Concentrate.</b> By this we mean that when you study, you
should do it to the exclusion of everything else. Keep your mind upon
the subject. You may find this difficult at first. Your mind will
wander; but you will soon acquire the student habit if you persevere.
</p>

<p><b>3d.</b> <b>Have Faith in Yourself.</b> Do not be easily discouraged. You
have the power to master this subject and <i>you will</i>. You will find it
of immeasurable value to you to be able to speak and write fluently and
correctly. Those whom you admire for their ready use of good English
were not born with the "gift of gab." They learned how to speak by
studying the rules of grammar, the meaning of words, just as you are
studying them. What they have done, <i>you will do</i>.
</p>

<p><b>4th.</b> <b>Go Slowly and Surely.</b> Do not skim through these lessons.
Be sure you understand thoroughly as you go along. Read carefully
and <i>think</i> for yourself. If there is anything you do not understand at
any time, write us and ask about it. These lessons have been carefully
prepared and are for your benefit. Make them yours and call upon us
freely for help. This is your College and its only ideal is service.
</p>

<p><b>5th.</b> <b>Get a Note-Book.</b> Make your note-book your work-shop.
Write in it an outline of each lesson. Fill it with notes, examples, anything
which is of interest on the subject. Note down your own frequent
mistakes in the use of English. Watch the conversation of your friends;
listen to good speakers. Write down the mistakes you notice. Whenever
you hear a word which seems particularly good, or when you see
one in your reading, write it in your note-book and make it part of your
<span class="corr" title="vocabularly">vocabulary</span>. You will find your interest continually growing and also your ability to express the thoughts you yearn to express.
</p>

<p>If we can bring to you an increasing joy in life because of a growing
power of expression; if we can enlarge your ability to serve the
world; if we can, through the study of this wonderful language of
ours, open wider the door of opportunity for you,&mdash;our comrade,&mdash;The
People's College will have served its purpose and realized its ideal.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_11" title="pg 11"></a>
GOOD ENGLISH&mdash;WHAT IS IT?</h3>

<p><b id="sec_1">1.</b> People seem to differ in their idea as to what constitutes "Good
English." Have you never seen a man suddenly called upon to make a
formal speech or introduced into the company of distinguished men and
women? Quite often, he will drop his simple every-day mode of speech
and speak in stilted, unnatural language, using all the "big" words he
can possibly remember. He no doubt fondly imagines he is making
an impression and using "good" English.
</p>

<p>The purpose of language is to make one's self understood, and, of
course, this can be done in very simple and crude English. The man
who breaks every rule of grammar, intersperses his remarks with every
variety of slang phrase, may make himself understood, but he is not
using <i>good</i> English.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_2">2.</b> <b>Good English is that which is good for its purpose and conforms
to the standards of usage.</b>
</p>

<p>We have one purpose when we write a business letter and quite
another when we are writing or speaking of the great issues of life.
There is a place for the simple, direct, plain, unadorned language of
every-day business life&mdash;the life of the work-a-day world&mdash;and there is
a place also for the beauty and charm of the language of poetry. If
we are talking with the man who works beside us of the work of the
day, we will naturally use plain, simple, forceful words. But, if we are
speaking to our comrades, striving to arouse them out of their lethargy,
to stir them to action as men and women, we will just as naturally use
the fine and noble words which touch the depths of human emotion&mdash;the
heights of human endeavor.
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> There are certain rules for the use of English which have grown
up through the years, to which we must conform. These are not arbitrary.
They have not been made by any man or any set of men.
In fact, they are constantly changing, as the common usage of the
people forces the changes. For these rules are only the expression of
the common usage, and as usage changes, the rules change.
</p>

<p>But these changes come slowly, so we can set down in a book the
rules which express the established usage of today. The ability to use
good English does not mean the ability to use long, high-sounding words.
To be a master of good English means to be able to use the word that
meets your need and use it correctly.
</p>

<p>Do not strive for <i>effect</i>, strive for <i>effective expression</i>.
</p>

<h3>USE YOUR DICTIONARY</h3>

<p><b id="sec_4">4.</b> Do you know that the average individual cripples through life
with a vocabulary of a few hundred words when he might easily have at
his command as many thousands?
</p>

<p>We are misers with our words. Here hid away in this book we call
the dictionary is a wealth of words, a rich mine of expression, and yet
in our every-day conversation we halt and stammer, using meaningless
words and phrases largely made up of current slang.
</p>

<p>Never let a word pass by that you do not understand thoroughly.
Look it up at once in your dictionary and master it then and there.

Dollars may be difficult to earn and more difficult to keep, but here is
a wealth easily gained and the more you use it the more you possess it.

<p>You will find your dictionary an exceedingly interesting book when
you get acquainted with it.
</p>

<p>Use it constantly; make it your familiar companion.

<h3>OUR LANGUAGE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_5">5.</b> Did you ever stop to think what the world would be if we had
no way of communicating, one with another? Think of Helen Keller,
shut up in her prison-house of silence. Her only mode of communication
with her fellows is through the sense of touch.
</p>

<p>Every form of life that has consciousness has some way of expressing
its feelings. Every animal, by the movements of its body or the
tones of its voice, expresses its emotions of pain, pleasure, rage, hate,
joy, hunger and the many passions that sway its life. The child knows
without being taught how to express its wants. We understand its cry
of hunger, its scream of pain, its laugh of delight. This is the natural
language, the language of feeling. It is the universal language that
needs no rules and no interpreter. Life on every plane knows and
understands it.
</p>

<h3>WHEN WE BEGIN TO THINK</h3>

<p><b id="sec_6">6.</b> Our feelings and desires are not the only things we wish to communicate.
The natural language satisfies a child for a time, but as the
child grows he begins to <i>think</i>, then he feels the need of a more effective
means of expressing himself. You can express your feelings to a certain
extent by the natural language. You can make one know that you are
glad by the expression of the face, the attitude of the body or the tone
of the voice. But could you make anyone understand <i>why</i> you are glad,
by these signs and gestures?
</p>

<p><b id="sec_7">7.</b> To express thoughts and ideas, man had to devise another sort
of language. So the language of <i>words</i> grew up out of the need to
communicate ideas to other people. As man's ability to think grew,
so his language grew. At first, this language was only a spoken language.
The ideas of one generation were handed down to the next by
the spoken word. Gradually a crude form of writing was invented
from which our written language has developed. This has made it
possible to put the wisdom of the ages into books for the benefit of
the world.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_8">8.</b> <b>Hence, language is the means of expressing thought and
feeling.</b> It has grown out of our need for expression.
</p>

<p><b>A word is a symbol of an idea.</b> It is a sound or combination of
sounds which we use to represent an idea. The use of words makes it
possible for us to readily convey our thoughts to other people.
</p>

<p>Through the medium of words we are able to communicate to
others our thoughts, not only of the external world about us, but also
of the mental world in which we live. We can tell of our loves, our
hates, our dreams and our ideals. Animals find the natural language of
looks and tones and gestures sufficient because they live almost wholly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_13" title="pg 13"></a>
upon the physical plane. But man lives in a mental world as well as in
a physical one, and must have a spoken and written language by which
to express his thoughts.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Select from the following sentences those which it is possible to
express by a look or tone or gesture, and those which can not be expressed
without words:</p>


<ol>
<li>I am glad.</li>
<li>I am glad because men are struggling for freedom.</li>
<li>I am hungry.</li>
<li>I am hungry for the chance for an education.</li>
<li>Come.</li>
<li>Come, let us reason together.</li>
<li>I am afraid.</li>
<li>I am afraid that we must wait long for peace.</li>
<li>Go.</li>
<li>Go, search the world over for the truth.</li>
<li>I am disgusted.</li>
<li>I am disgusted with those who will not think for themselves.</li>
<li>I am tired.</li>
<li>I am tired of these petty squabbles among comrades.</li>
</ol>


<h3>OUR EXPRESSION</h3>

<p><b id="sec_9">9.</b> Our knowledge of language opens up a new world to us. We
can communicate with those about us; we can open the storehouse of
the knowledge of the past as recorded in books, or as two of our writers
have expressed it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever rightly considered what the mere ability to read means&mdash;that
it is the key which admits to the world of thought and fancy and imagination&mdash;to
the company of saint and sage, of the wisest and wittiest at their
wisest and wittiest moments&mdash;that it enables us to see with the keenest eyes,
hear with the finest ears and listen to the sweetest voices of all time?<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Lowell.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Strip man of his books and his papers, and he becomes a mere slave,
ignorant of his own resources, ignorant of his rights and opportunities. The
difference between the free citizen of today and the savage of yesterday is
almost entirely a thing of books. The man who dislikes books can never be
entirely happy, and he who loves a good book can never be wholly miserable.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Hillis.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you never felt that struggle within and the sense of defeat
when you have tried to make some one feel as you feel, understand as
you understand, see some great truth as you see it, and could not find
the words with which to express your ideas?
</p>

<p><b id="sec_10">10.</b> The mastery of words gives; first, <i>the ability to understand the
spoken or written thoughts of others</i>; second, <i>the ability to adequately
express our own thoughts</i>; and third, <i>the ability to think clearly and to
grow in our intellectual life</i>.
</p>

<p>A connected chain of reasoning is impossible without the knowledge
of the words that express the development of the ideas and the varying
<a class="pagenum" id="page_14" title="pg 14"></a>
shades of meaning. To gain this mastery, you must know the words of
our language and their use. Words are the symbols of ideas and perform
certain functions in expressing our thoughts. This, simply stated,
is all that the study of English Grammar comprises&mdash;<i>the study of English
words and their use in the expression of thought and feeling</i>.
</p>

<h3>THE THOUGHT AND THE WORD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_11">11.</b> We have found that the invention of words grew out of the
ability to <i>think</i> and the need for expression. But we first <i>thought</i>! So,
in order to express yourself clearly you must first <i>think</i> clearly. Any
thought can be simply and clearly expressed. When you read something
difficult of understanding, where the thought is buried under an
avalanche of words, you can be assured the writer was not thinking
clearly. He did not have the perfect mastery of his thought. On the
other hand, one may have a valuable thought in mind and not be able to
express it because he does not have the words at his command. In the
one case, we have words and no idea; in the other, the idea and no words.
</p>

<p>This study is intended to enable you to master words, the tools of
expression. In whatever work you are engaged, it was first necessary
to learn to use the tools with which you work. So, you must master the
use of English words, the tools of your expression. You can in that
way learn to express your thoughts clearly and exactly. You will not
need to resort to slang, or to the tiresome repetition of a few words.
</p>

<p>The best of everything is none too good for you. It is your right,
your heritage, and the best in the English language will bring you into
the company and comradeship of the men and women who have striven
and toiled for humanity, who will talk to you of dreams and deeds worth
while, who will place in your hands the key to a new world.
</p>

<h3>A COMPLETE THOUGHT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_12">12.</b> When we want to express a thought we use more than one
word. Words are the symbols of ideas, but a thought is the expression
of the relation between ideas. For example, I say <i>man</i>, and you get an
idea or an image in your mind of a man, but I have not said anything
about any man. But if I say, <i>Man works</i>, then I have expressed a
thought. I have related the idea of a man and the idea of work and
have expressed a complete thought.
</p>

<p>So we express our thoughts by <i>groups of words</i>. The very smallest
group of words which will express a complete thought must, therefore,
contain two words. If I say <i>men</i>, <i>fire</i>, <i>flowers</i>, and stop, you wonder
what I mean, for I have not expressed a thought. Or, I might say,
<i>work</i>, <i>burns</i>, <i>bloom</i>, and you would still be in the dark as to my meaning;
but, when I say, <i>Men work</i>, <i>Fire burns</i>, <i>Flowers bloom</i>, you understand,
for I have told you my complete thought. I have put two words
together in a way to make sense; I have formed a sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_13">13.</b> If we say, <i>Go</i> or <i>Wait</i>, in the form of a command or entreaty,
the single word seems to make complete sense and to form a sentence
in itself. But this is only because <i>you</i>, who are to do the going or the
waiting, is clearly implied. The words <i>go</i> or <i>wait</i>, by themselves, do not
make sense or form a sentence unless they are uttered in the commanding
<a class="pagenum" id="page_15" title="pg 15"></a>
or beseeching tone of voice which makes you understand that <i>You
go</i> or <i>You wait</i> is the intended meaning. With the exception of words
used in this way as a command or entreaty, it is always necessary to
use at least two words to express a complete thought.
</p>

<p>But will any two words make a sentence&mdash;express a complete
thought?
</p>

<p><b id="sec_14">14.</b> Which of these combinations of words are sentences and which
are not?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Busy men.</li>
<li>Men travel.</li>
<li>Snow flies.</li>
<li>Blue sky.</li>
<li>Red flag.</li>
<li>Rustling trees.</li>
<li>Workers strike.</li>
<li>Bees sting.</li>
<li>Grass grows.</li>
<li>Cold winds.</li>
<li>Green fields.</li>
<li>Happy children.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Busy men</i> does not express a complete thought. We are wondering
<i>busy men do what?</i> But, <i>men travel</i> is a complete thought. It makes
sense and forms a sentence, and tells us what men <i>do</i>. In the words,
<i>busy men</i>, we have spoken the name of something but have made no
assertion concerning it. In the two words, <i>men travel</i>, we have spoken
the name <i>men</i> and we have told what they <i>do</i>.
</p>

<p>If we were walking down the street together we might say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The street is crowded to-day.</li>
<li>Does the open road attract you?</li>
<li>See the jostling crowds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or if we were discussing the class struggle, we might say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two classes have always existed.</li>
<li>To which class do you belong?</li>
<li>Join your class in the struggle.</li>
</ul>

<p>In every one of these six groups of words we have a complete
thought expressed. Each of these groups of words we call a sentence.</p>

<p><b id="sec_15">15.</b> <b>A sentence is a group of words expressing a complete
thought.</b></p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Write in each blank space the word necessary to express a complete
thought.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Men......</td>        <td>......fade.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaves......</td>     <td>......bloom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Water......</td>       <td>......run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fire...... </td>     <td>......write.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Women......</td>      <td>......grow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Children......</td>  <td>......speak.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>SUBJECT AND PREDICATE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_16">16.</b> We have found that every sentence must have at least two
words, one word to name that about which something is said and another
word which does the saying or makes the assertion. In the sentence,
<i>Men work</i>, we have these two parts; <i>men</i> which is the part about which
something is said, and <i>work</i> which tells what men do.
</p>

<p><b>The part about which something is said is called the subject.</b></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_16" title="pg 16"></a>
In this sentence, <i>Men work</i>, <i>men</i>, therefore, is the subject, for it
names that about which something is said.</p>

<p><b id="sec_17">17.</b> <b>The part that asserts or says something about the subject
is called the predicate.</b></p>

<p>Therefore in this sentence, <i>Men work</i>, <i>work</i> is
the predicate. In
the following sentences draw a single line under the subject and a double
line under the predicate, thus, <i><span class="underline">Birds</span> <span class="doubleunderline">fly</span></i>.</p>


<ul>
<li>Ships sail.</li>
<li>Soldiers fight.</li>
<li>Flowers fade.</li>
<li>Horses neigh.</li>
<li>Flags wave.</li>
<li>Snow comes.</li>
<li>War rages.</li>
<li>Winds blow.</li>
<li>Fish swim.</li>
</ul>


<p><b id="sec_18">18.</b> We may add other words to the subject or the predicate and
so enlarge their meaning, as for instance we may say:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stately ships sail proudly away.</li>
<li>The war in Europe rages furiously.</li>
<li>The soldiers in the army fight like men gone mad.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet in every one of these sentences you will find the subject and the
predicate,&mdash;<i>Ships sail</i>, <i>War rages</i>, <i>Soldiers fight</i>.
</p>

<p>Every sentence must have a subject and a predicate, and it is a
very important part of the study of sentences to be able to distinguish
quickly and readily the subject and the predicate. Find that about
which something is said, and that will always be the subject. Find that
which is said about the subject, and that will be the predicate.
</p>

<p><b>Every sentence must contain a subject and a predicate.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The subject of a sentence names that about which something
is said.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The predicate tells that which is said about the subject.</b></p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>In the following sentences add other words to the subject and to
the predicate to enlarge their meaning, then draw a single line under the
subject and a double line under the predicate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ships sail.</li>
<li>Tides flow.</li>
<li>Stars shine.</li>
<li>Rain falls.</li>
<li>Children play.</li>
<li>Nature sleeps.</li>
<li>Waves break.</li>
<li>War rages.</li>
<li>Birds sing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the subject and the predicate have other
words added to enlarge their meaning. Find the subject and predicate
and draw a single line under the subject and a double line under the
predicate, as in the sentence,
</p>

<p><i>The <span class="underline">workers</span> of the world <span class="doubleunderline">build</span> palaces for other
people.</i></p>

<ol>
<li>Our success lies in solidarity.</li>
<li>New occasions teach new duties.</li>
<li>Two classes exist in the world.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_17" title="pg 17"></a>
Labor creates all wealth.</li>
<li>The workers fight all battles.</li>
<li>Our time calls for earnest deeds.</li>
<li>Knowledge unlocks the door of life.</li>
<li>Ignorance bars the path to progress.</li>
<li>Few people think for themselves.</li>
<li>Hope stirs us to action.</li>
</ol>

<h2>SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 1</h2>

<p><b>Spelling is the process of naming or writing in proper order the
letters of a word.</b> There is nothing that marks us so quickly as lacking
in the qualities that go to make up a good education as our inability
to spell the words most commonly used.
</p>

<p>Spelling in English is rather difficult. If each letter represented
but one sound, spelling would be an easy matter. Every word would
be spelled just as it sounds. This is the goal of those who advocate
phonetic spelling. Phonetic spelling simply means spelling according to
sound. But our alphabet does not have a letter for every sound.
</p>

<p>There are some forty-two different sounds used in English words
and we have only twenty-six letters in the alphabet. Therefore some
letters must do duty for several sounds. Then we have words which
contain letters which are not sounded at all when the word is pronounced,
so, all in all, spelling is a matter of memorizing.
</p>

<p>The best way to become an accurate speller is to read much, to observe
closely the forms of words and to write frequently. Always spell
any word of which you are uncertain aloud several times and write
it out several times. In this way you have aided the memory both
through the eye and through the ear. If you are not sure of the spelling
of a word do not use it until you have looked it up in the dictionary
and made sure.
</p>
<p>The words in this lesson are taken out of Lesson 1, Plain English
Course. There are thirty in all, five for each day of the week. (1)
Look up the meaning in the dictionary. (2) Learn the correct spelling.
(3) Learn the correct pronunciation. (4) Use the word in a sentence
of your own construction. (5) Use it during the day in your conversation;
strive to make it a part of your working vocabulary.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 2</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>Review Lesson 1 before taking up this lesson.
Do not try to learn by rote the contents of these lessons. Our endeavor
is to make you see the reason for every rule and definition before they
are given. We want you to see unfolding before you the development
of language and through this evolution you can catch a glimpse of the
developing life of man. Language like customs, religion, government,
has grown with the economic advancement of man. As man has evolved
on the economic plane, the material plane, as he has improved his means
of providing for himself food and clothes and shelter, he has developed
a language suited to his needs.
</p>

<p>So we can trace the growth of the race as we study the development
of language from the sign language of the primitive savage to the language
of the philosopher of today by which he makes known to us the
story of the stars, and the innermost secrets of our hearts and minds.
Civilization began with the invention of the phonetic alphabet and the
use of writing. So the study of language becomes not a dull and stupid
conning of useless rules and formulas, but an absorbing study of a living,
growing, changing thing that mirrors forth the very life of man.
</p>

<p>Think while you study. As you look for the definition of words
in your dictionary and realize how many shades of meaning we can
express in words, remember that this power is a heritage that comes
to us from a long past of incessant struggle.
</p>

<p>We of to-day are also writing history in words. By our efforts
we are adding new words to the language and giving old words a richer
meaning. <i>Brotherhood</i>, <i>justice</i>, for example! The world is coming to
understand these glorious words more fully and giving them a new
interpretation.</p>

<p>You will see a new beauty and glory in words after you have finished
this course and you will have a mastery of this wonderful language
of ours.
</p>

<p>Watch carefully the use of words in your reading. Especially
this week distinguish the nouns and verbs. Use your dictionary constantly
and add a few words to your vocabulary every day.
</p>

<p>Whenever there is a word used in these lessons which you do not
thoroughly understand, look it up at once in your dictionary and master
it then and there. Make a list in your note book of the words you look
up and at the end of the week go over them again and see if you have
them clearly in mind. Watch also the pronunciation of the words. Do
not try to do everything all at once, nor should you be discouraged if
your progress seems slow. We approach the goal one step at a time
and each step takes us nearer and nearer. Just keep steadily at it,
Comrade.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_19" title="pg 19"></a>
KINDS OF SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_19">19.</b> We have found that we use sentences to express our thoughts.
But we also find that we use these sentences in different ways for different
purposes. Can you notice any difference in the following sentences?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Two classes have always existed.</li>
<li>To which class do you belong?</li>
<li>Join your class in the struggle.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say, <i>Two classes have always existed</i>, I am making a simple
assertion, stating what I know or believe to be true.</p>

<p>When I say, <i>To which class do you belong?</i> I am asking a question.</p>

<p>When I say, <i>Join your class in the struggle</i>, I am giving a command
or making a request.</p>

<p><b id="sec_20">20.</b> <b>These three kinds of sentences are called assertive, interrogative
and imperative.</b></p>

<p><b>An assertive sentence states a fact or an opinion.</b></p>

<p><b>An interrogative sentence asks a question.</b></p>

<p><b>An imperative sentence gives a command, makes a request or
expresses a wish.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_21">21.</b> Any of these three kinds of sentences may be exclamatory;
that is, it may express surprise, excitement, impatience, or some other
emotion. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Hurrah! Freedom is coming!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an assertion expressed as an exclamation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh! Why should war continue?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have a question in the form of an exclamation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Come! Keep your courage up.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this, we have a command, an imperative sentence, expressed in
the form of an exclamation.
</p>

<p><b>An exclamatory sentence expresses surprise, excitement or some
other emotion.</b>
</p>

<p>In these three forms of sentences, the assertive, the interrogative
and the imperative, together with the exclamatory, we are able to express
every thought and feeling which demands expression, either for practical
or artistic purposes.
</p>

<p>The sentence is the basis of spoken and written language and as
we trace its development we trace the history of the evolution of man
and the growth of his power of expression, as he has developed his powers
of mind.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_22">22.</b> <b>Every sentence must begin with a capital letter.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Every assertive and imperative sentence should end with a
period.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Every interrogative sentence should end with a question mark.</b>
</p>

<p>The word in an exclamatory sentence which expresses strong emotion
is followed by an exclamation point. The sentence itself if in
interrogative
<a class="pagenum" id="page_20" title="pg 20"></a>
form should be followed by a question mark; if in the assertive
or the imperative form it may be followed either by an exclamation
point or a period.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Mark the assertive sentences among the following with an <i>a</i> in the
blank space. Mark the interrogative sentences with a <i>q</i> for question;
the imperative sentences with a <i>c</i> for command; and the exclamatory
with an <i>e</i> for exclamation.</p>

<ol>
<li> ...... Books are the true levelers.</li>
<li> ...... Put not your trust in princes.</li>
<li> ...... To err is human; to forgive divine.</li>
<li> ...... What are the rights of a child?</li>
<li> ...... Seize common occasions and make them great.</li>
<li> ...... Not until all are free, is any free.</li>
<li> ...... Freemen! Shall not we demand our own?</li>
<li> ...... Is a world of happiness but a Utopian dream?</li>
<li> ...... He who will not work, shall not eat.</li>
<li> ...... Strike at the polls for freedom!</li>
<li> ...... Do the majority want social justice?</li>
<li> ...... A friend is the hope of the heart.</li>
<li> ...... How beautiful is the vision of peace!</li>
<li> ...... Acquire the thinking habit.</li>
<li> ...... Is it glorious to die for our country?</li>
<li> ...... Lo! Women are waking and claiming their own!</li>
<li> ...... Claim your right to the best.</li>
<li> ...... What is the highest good?</li>
<li> ...... Workers of the world, unite!</li>
<li> ...... To remain ignorant is to remain a slave.</li>
</ol>

<h3>WORDS&mdash;THEIR USES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_23">23.</b> We have learned from our study that we use sentences to express
our thoughts. These sentences are made up of words; therefore
we call words <i>parts of speech</i>. Words are only fractions or parts of
speech, and it is by combining them into sentences that we are able to
express our thoughts.

<p>There are many thousands of words in the English language. It
would be impossible for us to study each word separately. But these
words, like people, are divided into classes, so we can study each class
of words. These thousands of words are divided into classes much as
people are, or rather as people ought to be; for words are divided into
classes according to the work which they do. In the Industrial Commonwealth
there will be no upper or lower class, but men will be divided
into groups according to the work which they do. There will be various
industrial groups, groups of agricultural workers, groups of clerical
workers, etc. So words are divided into classes according to the work
which they do in helping us to express our ideas.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_24">24.</b> <b>Words are divided into kinds or classes according to their
use in sentences.</b>
</p>

<p><b>There are eight of these classes of words, called parts of speech.</b></p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_21" title="pg 21"></a>
THE NAMES OF THINGS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_25">25.</b> What a word <i>does</i> determines what part of speech it is.
When primitive man, long ago, first began to use words, in all probability
the first words which he invented were those used to name familiar
objects about him. He invented a word for <i>man</i>, <i>boy</i>, <i>tree</i>, <i>animal</i>, etc.
Gradually, all the things he met in his daily life received a name. About
one half of the words in our language are of this class, the <i>names</i> of
things.
</p>

<p>Every word which is used as a name of something is called a <i>noun</i>.
This word <i>noun</i> is derived from the Latin word which means <i>name</i>, so
it is quite the same thing as saying <i>name</i>. Notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Boys run.</li>
<li>Fish swim.</li>
<li>Horses neigh.</li>
<li>Soldiers march.</li>
<li>Flags wave.</li>
<li>Flowers fade.</li>
<li>Girls study.</li>
<li>Winds blow.</li>
<li>Men work.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the words used like <i>boys</i>, <i>girls</i>, <i>fish</i>, <i>horses</i>, <i>soldiers</i>, <i>flag</i>, <i>winds</i>, <i>flowers</i> and <i>men</i>, are the names of objects, therefore all of these words are <i>nouns</i>. The subject of a sentence is always a noun or a word
used as a noun. However, we may use in a sentence many nouns besides
the noun which is used as the subject, the noun about which the statement
is made. We will study the use of these nouns later in our lessons.
</p>

<p><i>The famous palace of the kings of the Moors, at Granada, in Spain,
was called the Alhambra.</i> We have six nouns in this sentence, <i>palace</i>,
<i>kings</i>, <i>Moors</i>, <i>Granada</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>Alhambra</i>, but the noun <i>palace</i> is the
noun which is the subject&mdash;the noun which is the name of that about
which something is said. <i>Palace</i> is the subject; and <i>was called</i> is the
predicate in this sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_26">26.</b> <b>A noun is a word used as the name of something.</b></p>

<p>Now we want to learn to distinguish every word that is used as a
name. Pick out the nouns as you read your books and papers until you
are able to tell every word which is used as a noun, the name of something.
</p>

<p>In the following paragraph, the nouns are printed in italics. Carefully
study these nouns:
</p>

<p>The <i>fire</i> in the <i>grate</i>, the <i>lamp</i> by the <i>bedside</i>, the <i>water</i> in the <i>tumbler</i>,
the <i>fly</i> on the <i>ceiling</i> above, the <i>flower</i> in the <i>vase</i> on the <i>table</i>, all
<i>things</i> have their <i>history</i> and can reveal to us <i>nature's</i> invisible <i>forces</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Underscore every noun in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole history of the earth has been one of gradual development, of
progress, of slow and painful climbing through the ages. Not only have the
hills and the mountains, the rivers and the stars, the trees and the cattle,
the beasts and the birds, been developing; but man himself&mdash;his mind and his
body&mdash;has been developing. Men are marvelous little creatures; they have
weighed the sun in their balances, measured the stars and analyzed the light
and beauty of the rainbow; they have sounded the depths of the ocean; they
<a class="pagenum" id="page_22" title="pg 22"></a>
have learned how the sun and the mountains were born and the rivers were
laid in their mighty beds; they have learned how the seas became salt, what
the stars are made of. They have learned so much, and yet when it comes to
matters of time and space, and law and motion, they still know so little. The
only man who is conscious of his ignorance is he who has learned a great
deal.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>McMillan.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>


<h3>WORDS THAT ASSERT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_27">27.</b> After the primitive man had invented names for the things
about him, probably his next step was to invent words of action. He
very naturally wanted to tell what all of these various things <i>did</i>. So
the words that tell what things do, the words of action, the words that
assert, came into the language. A child follows much the same development.
As you can readily observe, it first names the objects about it,
then learns the words that tell what these objects do.
</p>

<p>So the words that tell what things <i>do</i>, become the second class of
words. These words we call <i>verbs</i>. The word <i>verb</i>, like the word <i>noun</i>,
is taken into our language from the Latin. In Latin, the word <i>verbum</i>
means <i>the word</i>; and the verb is practically <i>the</i> word in a sentence, for
we cannot have a sentence without a verb. You may string a number
of words together, but if you do not have an asserting word, you will not
have a sentence.
</p>

<p>Notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Men work.</li>
<li>Flowers fade.</li>
<li>Snow flies.</li>
<li>Winds blow.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, the words <i>work</i>, <i>fade</i>, <i>flies</i> and <i>blow</i>, are the
words used to assert or say something of the subject, hence they are the
verbs in these sentences.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_28">28.</b> Sometimes it takes more than one word to express the action
or make the assertion. Notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The men are working.</li>
<li>The boy has been studying.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence it takes two words, <i>are working</i>, to make the
assertion; in the second, three are required, <i>has been studying</i>. These
groups of words are called <i>verb phrases</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_29">29.</b> <b>A verb is a word that asserts.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A verb phrase is a group of words used as a single verb.</b>
</p>

<p>The verb is perhaps the most difficult part of speech to master.
It is not hard to find the verb in short sentences, but in longer sentences
it is sometimes difficult.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sun shines.</li>
<li>The man walks.</li>
<li>The boys strike.</li>
</ul>

<p>We very easily see that <i>shine</i>, <i>walk</i> and <i>strike</i> are the verbs in these
sentences. But let us add other words, as for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_23" title="pg 23"></a>
The sun shines brightly.</li>
<li>The man walks for his health.</li>
<li>The boys strike the dog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we are very apt to confuse the verb with the words which
state <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> the action is performed, or the <i>object</i> towards which
the action is directed. But in these sentences, <i>shine</i> and <i>walks</i> and <i>strike</i>
are still the verbs, just as in the first sentences. The verb asserts the
action; the other words merely give additional information about <i>how</i>
or <i>why</i> or <i>upon what</i> the action is performed.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_30">30.</b> Another thing which makes it difficult for us to distinguish
verbs in English is that the same word may be used both as a noun and
as a verb; but always remember that words are separated into classes
according to the work which they do. When a word is used as a <i>name</i>
it is a <i>noun</i>; when it is used as an <i>asserting</i> word it is a <i>verb</i>. Note the
following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>play</i> made the child tired.</li>
<li>The children <i>play</i> in the yard.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence <i>play</i> is a noun, the subject of the verb <i>made</i>.
In the second sentence <i>play</i> is the verb, telling what the children <i>do</i>.
Always classify words according to the work which they perform in the
sentence. This will help you very much in finding your verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_31">31.</b> Then we have some verbs which do not assert action but express
rather a connection or relation between the subject and some other
word or words. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The dog belongs to the man.</li>
<li>The girl is happy.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences <i>belongs</i> and <i>is</i> are the verbs. <i>Belongs</i> asserts
or shows the relation between <i>the dog</i> and <i>the man</i>. <i>Is</i> shows the relation
between <i>the girl</i> and <i>happy</i>. If we simply say <i>girl</i> and <i>happy</i>, we do
not show any connection between them or make any statement relating
the two, but when we say, <i>The girl is happy</i>, we are asserting something,
and the word <i>is</i> makes the assertion.
</p>

<p>Or when we say, <i>The girl was happy</i>, or <i>The girl will be</i> or <i>may be
happy</i>, in each of these cases, it is the verb or <span class="corr" title="verb-phrase">verb phrase</span> <i>was</i> or <i>will be</i>
or <i>may be</i>, that asserts or shows the relation between the subject <i>girl</i>
and the descriptive word <i>happy</i>. You will observe that the verbs <i>will be</i>
and <i>may be</i> are composed of more than one word and are <i>verb
phrases</i>.
</p>

<p>We will study the verb in succeeding lessons, but let us remember
from this lesson that the word or group of words that makes the assertion
in the sentence is the verb. Remember too that every sentence
must contain a verb.
</p>

<p>Get this basic principle firmly fixed in mind that what a word <i>does</i>
decides what it <i>is</i>&mdash;to what part of speech it belongs, and that every
class of words fulfills its own function in sentence building.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_32">32.</b> Remember:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Every sentence must have a subject and a predicate.</b></p>

<p><b>Every sentence must express a complete thought.</b></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_24" title="pg 24"></a>
<b>Every sentence must contain a verb.</b></p>

<p><b>A noun is the name of something.</b></p>

<p><b>A verb is a word that asserts.</b></p>

<p><b>What a word does determines what it is.</b></p>

<p>Study carefully the following quotation. The verbs are printed
in <i>italics</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slowly, painfully, <i>proceeds</i> the struggle of man against the power of
Mammon. The past <i>is written</i> in tears and blood. The future <i>is</i> dim and
unknown, but the final outcome of this world-wide struggle <i>is</i> not in doubt.
Freedom <i>will conquer</i> slavery, truth <i>will prevail</i> over error, justice <i>will
triumph</i> over injustice, the light <i>will vanquish</i> the darkness; and humanity
<i>will rise</i> in the glory of universal brotherhood.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Warren</i>.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Underscore all verbs and verb phrases in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The Dream of Labor:</b> Ours is not the cause of one class, of one
sex, of one tribe, of one city, of one state, of one continent.
</p>

<p>It is the wish for a better world where Man shall be Man; where the
beast shall become subdued; where everything shall lead to complete development;
where the good of each shall be bound up in the good of all; where all
shall feel the sorrows of each and shall run to his rescue.
</p>

<p>A glimpse of this ideal takes us into the Land of Promise, where peace and
plenty shall reign supreme; where brothers shall no longer battle among
themselves, but for one another; where the atmosphere shall be laden with
love, the love that saves; where the hate that kills shall be unknown; where
heart and brain shall work together and shall make life better and more complete;
where the fullness of life shall be for all and where men and women
shall be as happy at their work as little children at their play.
</p>

<p>The mere glimpse into that land makes life worth living, makes work
worth doing, makes dreams worth dreaming, gives us hope and faith&mdash;the faith
we need in the labor for our cause, the faith which shall help us win.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Oscar
Leonard.</i></span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>We have found that there are a number of words in English which
may be used either as nouns or verbs, depending upon the function
they serve in the sentence. In the following sentences underscore the
nouns with a single line, the verbs with two lines:
</p>

<ol>
<li>They <i>man</i> the boats.</li>
<li>The <i>man</i> has a boat.</li>
<li>The women <i>pass</i> this way.</li>
<li>They held the <i>pass</i> for hours.</li>
<li>Little children <i>work</i> in the mines.</li>
<li>The <i>work</i> of the world is done by machinery today.</li>
<li>The armies will <i>cross</i> the bridge.</li>
<li>He built a <i>cross</i> of rude stones.</li>
<li>The leopard cannot <i>change</i> its spots.</li>
<li>We will force a <i>change</i> in the law.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_25" title="pg 25"></a>
Exercise 5</h4>

<p>In the following poem, mark every noun and every verb and verb
phrase. You will find the verb phrases in several places divided by the
word <i>not</i>, as in <i>I do not obey</i>. <i>Do obey</i> is the verb phrase. We will
learn to what part of speech <i>not</i> belongs a little later.
</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 2</h2>

<p>The twenty-six letters in the English alphabet are divided into
vowels and consonants. A vowel is a letter which represents a sound
of the human voice but slightly interrupted by the vocal organs. The
vowels are <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>. All of the remaining letters of the alphabet
are consonants. A consonant is a letter which represents a sound of the
human voice greatly obstructed by the vocal organs.
</p>

<p>Consonant is from the Latin <i>con</i>, meaning <i>with</i>, and <i>sono</i>&mdash;<i>I sound</i>.
So it means literally <i>I sound with</i>.
</p>

<p>The consonants are produced by union of the breath with the vocal
organs. The consonant sounds are so called because they are always
"sounded with" a vowel; they are used only in combination with vowels
in forming words or syllables.
</p>

<p>In English a consonant alone never forms a word or a syllable.
Sound the different consonants <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>,
<i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>, by themselves and you will see how the sound of the
breath is obstructed or changed by the use of the vocal organs&mdash;the lips,
the tongue, the teeth, etc.&mdash;in making these various sounds.
</p>

<p><i>W</i> and <i>y</i> are sometimes vowels and sometimes consonants. <i>W</i> and
<i>y</i> are vowels when they are used with another vowel representing a
vowel sound as in <i>awe</i>, <i>new</i>, <i>joy</i>, <i>eye</i>, etc. <i>Y</i> is sometimes used as a
vowel by itself as in <i>by</i>, <i>cry</i>, etc. <i>W</i> and <i>y</i> are consonants when they
are used at the beginning of a syllable or before a vowel in the same
syllable as in <i>wine</i>, <i>twine</i>, <i>yield</i> and <i>year</i>.
</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 3</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this lesson we are taking up a short study of the different parts
of speech. In later lessons we will study each part of speech more
thoroughly but this lesson covers the ground quickly and briefly. It is
sufficient, however, to form a basis for our understanding of the evolution
of language.
</p>

<p>You will see, as you study this lesson, how each part of speech has
been added to meet a growing need. There are many, many thousand
words in the English language, but they can all be grouped under these
eight parts of speech, for they all answer in some way to one of these
great needs.
</p>

<p>The object in studying grammar, as in studying any other science,
is not to fill one's mind with a great many unrelated facts&mdash;facts which
may or may not prove useful to one hereafter. The object of all study
is to develop one's power of observation and one's ability to think.
Added to this must be the practical ability to make use of this knowledge.
Here the study of grammar has an advantage over the study of
every other science. It deals with words, something which we use every
day.
</p>

<p>You do not need any laboratory or expensive apparatus in order to
study grammar. All that you need lies ready to your hand. And in
addition to this the knowledge which you gain is something which is of
practical use to every man and woman no matter what their work, no
matter what their place or position in life may be.
</p>

<p>Remember that dogmatism has no place in the study of grammar.
"Grammarians are the guardians, not the authors, of language." We
do not say, "You should say this or that, or you violate a rule of grammar,"
but we say "The common usage among those who use good English
is thus and so." If we do not believe that the common usage is the
best usage, then we follow the democratic method of seeking to change
the common usage into that which we consider the more sensible way.
Thus, those who advocate simplified spelling have not sought to pass a
law whereby every one should be compelled to spell words exactly as
they sound, but they have striven to influence our writers and people in
general to use this more sensible way of spelling words.
</p>

<p>So <i>think</i> while you study. Do not try to learn rules and formulas.
See <i>why</i> the rules and formulas exist. Once having seen this you do
not need to learn them&mdash;you know them already. The study of any
language is an intellectual discipline of the highest order.
</p>

<p>So apply yourself diligently to this most interesting study and you
will see that the result of this application will affect your daily life in
every particular.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_28" title="pg 28"></a>
WORDS ADDED TO NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_33">33.</b> When man began to invent words to express his ideas of the
world in which he lived, we have found that probably the first need was
that of names for the things about him. So we have nouns. The second
need was of words to tell what these things <i>do</i>, and so we have verbs.
But primitive man soon felt the need of other classes of words.
</p>

<p>The objects about us are not all alike. For example, we have a
word for man, but when we say <i>man</i> that is not sufficient to describe
the many different kinds of men. There are tall men, short men, white
men, black men, strong men, weak men, busy men, lazy men. There are
all sorts of men in the world, and we need words by which we can describe
these different types and also indicate which man we mean.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_34">34.</b> So we have a class of words which are called adjectives.
<i>Adjective</i> is a word derived from the Latin. It comes from the Latin
word <i>ad</i>, meaning <i>to</i>, and the Latin word <i>jecto</i>, which means <i>to throw</i>;
hence an adjective is a word <i>thrown to</i> or <i>added to</i> a noun.
</p>

<p>If you will stop to think for a moment, you will see that it is by
their qualities that we know the things about us. Some men are strong,
some are weak, some are tall, some are short. These qualities belong
to different men. And we separate or group them into classes as they
resemble each other or differ from one another in these qualities. Things
are alike which have the same qualities; things are unlike whose qualities
are different. Apples and oranges are alike in the fact that both
are round, both are edible. They are unlike in the fact that one is red
and one is yellow; one may be sour and the other sweet. So we separate
them in our minds because of their different qualities; and we have
a class of words, <i>adjectives</i>, which describe these various qualities.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_35">35.</b> We use adjectives for other purposes also. For example, when
we say <i>trees</i>, we are not speaking of any particular trees, but of trees
in general. But we may add certain adjectives which point out particular
trees, as for example: <i>these</i> trees, or <i>those</i> trees, or <i>eight</i> trees or
<i>nine</i> trees. These adjectives limit the trees of which we are speaking
to the particular trees pointed out. They do not express any particular
qualities of the trees like the adjectives <i>tall</i> or <i>beautiful</i> express, but they
limit the use of the word <i>trees</i> in its application. So we have our definition
of the adjective.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_36">36.</b> <b>An adjective is a word added to a noun to qualify or limit
its meaning.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Underscore all of the adjectives in the following quotation. Notice
also the nouns and verbs in this quotation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet fearsome and terrible are all the footsteps of men upon the earth,
for they either descend or climb.</p>

<p>They descend from little mounds and high peaks and lofty altitudes,
through wide roads and narrow paths, down noble marble stairs and creaky
stairs of wood&mdash;and some go down to the cellar, and some to the grave, and
some down to the pits of shame and infamy, and still some to the glory of an
unfathomable abyss where there is nothing but the staring, white, stony eye-balls
of Destiny.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_29" title="pg 29"></a>
They descend and they climb, the fearful footsteps of men, and some
limp, some drag, some speed, some trot, some run&mdash;they are quiet, slow, noisy, brisk,
quick, feverish, mad, and most awful in their cadence to the ears of the one
who stands still.
</p>

<p>But of all the footsteps of men that either descend or climb, no footsteps
are so fearsome and terrible as those that go straight on the dead level of a
prison floor, from a yellow stone wall to a red iron gate.<span class="author">&mdash;From <i>The Walker</i>.
<i>Giovannitti.</i></span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>WORDS ADDED TO VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_37">37.</b> From our study, you see how our classes of words grew out of
man's need of them in expressing his thoughts. And notice also how
the many thousands of words in our language can all be grouped under
these few classes. We <i>name</i> the things about us; we invent words to
tell what these things <i>do</i>; we have another class of words which <i>describe</i>
the things which we have named; and now we come to a fourth class of
words for which we also find great need.
</p>

<p>When we come to tell what things <i>do</i>, we find that we need words
which will tell us <i>how</i> or <i>where</i> or <i>when</i> these things are done. Notice
the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The men work busily.</li>
<li>The men work late.</li>
<li>The men work now.</li>
<li>The men work here.</li>
<li>The men work hard.</li>
<li>The men work well.</li>
<li>The men work inside.</li>
<li>The men work more.</li>
</ul>

<p>We would have a complete sentence and express a complete thought
if we said simply, <i>The men work</i>, but each of these words which we have
added, like <i>busily</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>late</i>, etc., adds something to the meaning of the
verb. These words add something to the action which is asserted by the
verb, for they show <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> and <i>how much</i> the men
work.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_38">38.</b> We call this class of words <i>adverbs</i>, because they are added to
verbs to make the meaning more definite, very much as adjectives are
added to nouns. Adverb means literally <i>to the verb</i>.
</p>

<p>An adverb will always answer one of these questions: <i>how?</i> <i>when?</i>
<i>how long?</i> <i>how often?</i> <i>how much?</i> <i>how far?</i> or <i>how late?</i> If you want
to find the adverbs in your sentences just ask one of these questions,
and the word that answers it will be the adverb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_39">39.</b> An adverb may be used also with an adjective. Notice the
following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The book is <i>very</i> long.</li>
<li><i>Too</i> many people never think.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice here that the adverbs <i>very</i> and <i>too</i> modify the adjectives
<i>long</i> and <i>many</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_40">40.</b> Adverbs may also be used with other adverbs. Notice the
following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He speaks <i>very</i> distinctly.</li>
<li>He walks <i>too</i> slowly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the adverbs <i>very</i> and <i>too</i> are used with the adverbs <i>distinctly</i>
and <i>slowly</i>, and add to their meaning. We will study more fully in later
<a class="pagenum" id="page_30" title="pg 30"></a>
lessons concerning both the adjective and the adverb, but we can see
by this brief study why adverbs were added as a class of words, a part
of speech, for they are absolutely necessary in order to describe the action
expressed by verbs, and also to add to the meaning of adjectives
and other adverbs. Hence we have our definition of an adverb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_41">41.</b> <b>An adverb is a word that modifies the meaning of a verb,
an adjective, or another adverb.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Underscore all adverbs in the following sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>He will not come today.</li>

<li>Here and now is the day of opportunity.</li>

<li>Very slowly, but even then entirely too rapidly, the fire crept
forward.</li>

<li>The room was very quiet and still.</li>

<li>He was too weary to go farther.</li>

<li>One must learn to feel deeply and think clearly in order to
express himself eloquently.</li>

<li>Ferrer stood there, so calmly and so bravely facing the firing
squad.</li>

<li>He was condemned to death because he stood uncompromisingly
and courageously for the education of the masses.</li>

<li>Ferrer understood thoroughly that the schools of today cleverly
and effectively adapt their teaching to maintain the present system of
society.</li>

<li>He said "The school imprisons the children physically, intellectually
and morally."</li>

</ol>

<h3>WORDS USED IN PLACE OF NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_42">42.</b> Now we come to study another class of words which are also
very necessary in order to express our ideas. Suppose you had just
arrived in a strange town and you wanted to find the way to a friend's
house. You inquire of a stranger, "Can you tell me who lives in the
house on the corner?"
</p>

<p>Notice the words <i>you</i> and <i>me</i> and <i>who</i>. You could not call the
stranger by name for you do not know his name, and hence you say <i>you</i>.
And if you used your own name instead of <i>me</i>, he would not recognize
it, and you would both be puzzled to find a substitute for that little
word <i>who</i>.
</p>

<p>If you knew the stranger and he knew your name, you might say,
"Can Mr. Smith tell Mr. Jones what person lives in the house on the
corner." But this would sound very stilted and unnatural and awkward.
So we have these little words like <i>you</i> and <i>me</i> and <i>who</i>, which we use <i>in
place of nouns</i>. These words are called pronouns. This word is taken
from the Latin also. In the Latin the word <i>pro</i> means <i>in place of</i>. So
the word pronoun means literally in place of a noun.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_43">43.</b> <b>A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun.</b>
</p>

<p>These pronouns are very useful little words. They save us a great
deal of tiresome repetition. Notice the awkwardness of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The workers will succeed in gaining the workers' freedom if the
workers learn solidarity.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_31" title="pg 31"></a>
And yet this would be the way we would have to express this idea
if we did not have pronouns. Instead we say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The workers will succeed in gaining their freedom if they learn
solidarity.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_44">44.</b> We will study the pronoun in detail in later lessons, but we
can readily recognize these words which are used in place of nouns.
The most common pronouns are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I</li>
<li>you</li>
<li>he</li>
<li>she</li>
<li>it</li>
<li>we</li>
<li>they</li>
<li>me</li>
<li>him</li>
<li>her</li>
<li>us</li>
<li>them</li>
<li>my</li>
<li>your</li>
<li>his</li>
<li>her</li>
<li>its</li>
<li>our</li>
<li>their</li>
<li>that</li>
<li>which</li>
<li>who</li>
<li>whose</li>
<li>whom</li>
<li>what</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Underscore the pronouns in the following story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A man in South Africa picked up a small piece of stone. It was dirty and
rough.</p>

<p>"Make me beautiful," said the stone.</p>

<p>"I shall have to hurt you," said the man.</p>

<p>"Well, if it hurts me, I will bear it," said the stone.</p>

<p>So the man took it to a clever craftsman, who put it into a tight vise,
and cut it with his sharp instrument.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the stone.</p>

<p>And he ground it till the dust fell all about it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the stone.</p>

<p>And he polished it very hard.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the stone.</p>

<p>And then he set it in a crown and sent it to the Queen. On a sunny day
she wore her crown, and the stone&mdash;it was a diamond&mdash;sparkled in long rays
of crimson and green and yellow and silvery white. And all the people
greeted their queen. She showed them her crown and they praised the
beautiful stone.</p>

<p>The training was hard, but the improvement was glorious.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>PREPOSITIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_45">45.</b> Notice the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want the book <i>on</i> the box.</li>
<li>I want the book <i>under</i> the box.</li>
<li>I want the book <i>in</i> the box.</li>
<li>I want the book <i>beside</i> the box.</li>
<li>I want the book <i>behind</i> the box.</li>
<li>I want the book <i>beyond</i> the box.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you notice any word in these sentences which does not belong
to any of the classes of words which we have studied? <i>I</i> is a pronoun,
<i>want</i> is a verb, <i>the</i> is an adjective, <i>book</i> is a noun, <i>the</i> is an adjective,
<i>box</i> is a noun; but the words, <i>on</i>, <i>under</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>beside</i>, <i>behind</i> and <i>beyond</i>
are not nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs or pronouns.
</p>

<p>Yet would it be possible to express the meaning in these sentences
without these words? Read the sentences without them, and you will
<a class="pagenum" id="page_32" title="pg 32"></a>
see that no one could tell the relation which you wish to express between
the <i>book</i> and the <i>box</i>. And you will notice too that each word
expresses a different relation, for it means one thing to say <i>on the box</i>
and another thing to say <i>in the box</i>, and so through the list.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_46">46.</b> The words which are used to show this relation are called
<i>prepositions</i>. The groups of words introduced by the preposition, like
<i>on the box</i> and <i>in the box</i>, and so on, are called prepositional phrases.
The noun which follows a preposition as <i>box</i> follows the prepositions <i>in</i>,
<i>on</i>, <i>beside</i>, <i>beyond</i>, etc., is called the <i>object</i> of the preposition.
</p>

<p><i>Preposition</i> is a word which comes into our language from the
Latin. It is formed from the Latin <i>pre</i>, which means <i>before</i>, and the
Latin verb which means <i>to place</i>, so preposition means literally <i>to place
before</i>. It is given this name because it is placed before the noun or
pronoun which is its object. Therefore our definition of a preposition
is as follows:
</p>

<p><b id="sec_47">47.</b> <b>A preposition is a word that shows the relation of its
object to some other word.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_48">48.</b> Either a noun or a pronoun may be the object of a preposition.
Notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring the book to me.</li>
<li>Lay the book on the table.</li>
<li>He will speak to you.</li>
<li>I will speak to the man.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the noun <i>table</i> is the object of the preposition
<i>on</i>; the pronoun <i>me</i> is the object of the preposition <i>to</i>; and in the last
two sentences the pronoun <i>you</i> and the noun <i>man</i> are the objects of the
preposition <i>to</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_49">49.</b> There are not many prepositions in the language and they are
easily learned and easily distinguished. Here is a list of the most common
and the most important prepositions. Use each one in a sentence.
</p>

<ul>
<li>at</li>
<li>across</li>
<li>around</li>
<li>about</li>
<li>among</li>
<li>above</li>
<li>against</li>
<li>along</li>
<li>behind</li>
<li>beside</li>
<li>between</li>
<li>below</li>
<li>beyond</li>
<li>by</li>
<li>before</li>
<li>beneath</li>
<li>down</li>
<li>for</li>
<li>from</li>
<li>in</li>
<li>into</li>
<li>off</li>
<li>on</li>
<li>over</li>
<li>to</li>
<li>toward</li>
<li>under</li>
<li>up</li>
<li>upon</li>
<li>with</li>
<li>within</li>
<li>without</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Underscore the prepositions in the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He went to the door and looked out upon the field.</li>
<li>Over the river and through the woods, to Grandfather's house we go.</li>
<li>He saw them in the distance as they were coming toward him.</li>
<li>They went along the road, across the bridge, and hid among the
trees at the foot of the hill.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_33" title="pg 33"></a>
They came from Minneapolis down the river by boat.</li>
<li>The war between the classes is a struggle against exploitation.</li>
<li>The army was intrenched behind the barricades before dawn.</li>
<li>His claim was within the law but without justice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_50">50.</b> We have found that the preposition is a very important connective
word. It connects two words and shows what one of them has
to do with the other, but the preposition is not the only connective word
which we use in English. We have another part of speech which performs
an important function as a connective word. Notice the following
sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Men and women struggle for their rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you find a word in this sentence which is a connective word
besides the preposition <i>for</i>? Did you notice that little word <i>and</i>? The
noun <i>men</i> and the noun <i>women</i> are both subjects of the verb <i>struggle</i>,
and they are joined by this little connective word <i>and</i>. If we did not
have this word we would have to use two sentences to express our
thought, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Men struggle for their rights.</li>
<li>Women struggle for their rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>But with the use of this connective word <i>and</i> we can combine these
two sentences and express it all in one sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Men <i>and</i> women struggle for their rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>This word is used in a different manner from the preposition. The
preposition connects two words and makes one modify the other. When
we say, <i>Get the book on the table</i>, the phrase <i>on the table</i> designates the
book just as much as if we had said, <i>Get the green book</i>. So the use of
the preposition enables us to show the relation between two words and
to make one word describe or modify the other.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_51">51.</b> This little word <i>and</i> in the sentence, <i>Men and women struggle
for their rights</i>, is a connective word also, but it connects two words
that are used in the same way, so it is a different sort of connective
word from the preposition. Words used in this way are called <i>conjunctions</i>.
Conjunction is a word which is taken from the Latin, being made
up of the Latin word <i>con</i>, which means <i>together</i>, and the Latin verb
<i>juncto</i>, which means <i>to join</i>. So conjunction means literally <i>to join
together</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_52">52.</b> <b>A conjunction is a word that connects sentences or parts
of sentences.</b>
</p>

<p>Notice the following sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The class struggle is waged on the political field and on the industrial
field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have the conjunction <i>and</i> connecting the two phrases <i>on the</i>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_34" title="pg 34"></a>
<i>political field</i> and <i>on the industrial field</i>. Without the use of this connective
word, we would have to use two sentences to express these two
thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The class struggle is waged on the political field.</li>
<li>The class struggle is waged on the industrial field.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_53">53.</b> So a conjunction may be used to connect phrases as well as
words.
</p>

<p>Now notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He will speak.        I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>and</i> I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>but</i> I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>if</i> I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>therefore</i> I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>because</i> I will listen.</li>
<li>He will speak, <i>until</i> I will listen.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_54">54.</b> These <i>sentences</i> are joined by different conjunctions, and the
conjunction used alters the meaning of the sentence.
</p>

<p>The conjunction is a very useful part of speech. Without it we
would have many disconnected sentences requiring tiresome repetition
of the same words. Like prepositions, there are not many conjunctions
in English and they are readily recognized.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_55">55.</b> We will study about these conjunctions at length in later lessons.
If you consult the following list of those most commonly used,
you can easily pick out the conjunctions in your reading:
</p>

<ul>
<li>and</li>
<li>as</li>
<li>as if</li>
<li>after</li>
<li>although</li>
<li>as soon as</li>
<li>because</li>
<li>besides</li>
<li>before</li>
<li>but</li>
<li>either</li>
<li>for</li>
<li>hence</li>
<li>in order that</li>
<li>lest</li>
<li>neither</li>
<li>nor</li>
<li>or</li>
<li>since</li>
<li>still</li>
<li>so</li>
<li>then</li>
<li>though</li>
<li>that</li>
<li>than</li>
<li>therefore</li>
<li>till</li>
<li>until</li>
<li>unless</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>whether</li>
<li>yet</li>
</ul>

<p>The seven classes of words which we have studied make up all of
our sentences. The hundreds of words which we use in forming our
sentences and expressing our thoughts belong to these seven classes.
They are either nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, prepositions
or conjunctions.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Underscore the conjunctions in the following sentences. Notice
whether they connect words or phrases or sentences.
</p>

<ol>
<li>We cannot win unless we are organized.</li>
<li>Books and music are true friends.</li>
<li>Men, women and children work under conditions neither proper nor just.</li>
<li>We must educate and organize.</li>
<li>The workers on the farms and in the factories must be united.</li>

<li>We do not understand the situation, because we do not know the facts.</li>
<li>Do you know whether these statements are true or false?</li>
</ol>



<div class="poem wide">
<p class="i6">IT CAN BE DONE</p>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Somebody said that it couldn't be done,</p>
<p class="i2">  But he, with a chuckle, replied</p>
<p>That "maybe it couldn't," but he would be one</p>
<p class="i2">  Who wouldn't say so till he tried.</p>
<p>So he buckled right in, with a trace of a grin</p>
<p class="i2">  On his face. If he worried he hid it.</p>
<p>He started to sing as he tackled the thing</p>
<p class="i2">  That couldn't be done&mdash;and he did it.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Somebody scoffed, "Oh, you'll never do that;</p>

<p>But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,</p>

<p>With the lift of his chin, and a bit of a grin,</p>
<p class="i2">  Without any doubting or quiddit,</p>

<p>Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing</p>
<p class="i2">That "can not be done,"&mdash;and you'll do it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>INTERJECTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_56">56.</b> There is another class of words which we use <i>with</i> sentences,
but which are really not <i>parts</i> of the sentences. They are emotional
expressions which seem to belong more to the natural language than to
the invented language. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh! You hurt me!</li>
<li>Aha! Now I have you.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Oh</i>, used in this way, is very apt to sound like a groan, and <i>aha</i>
like a shout of triumph. These words do not really belong in the construction
of the sentence. The sentence would be complete without
them, but they are thrown in to express the emotion which accompanies
the thought. We call expressions such as these <i>interjections</i>. Interjection
is from the Latin and means literally <i>thrown into the midst of</i>. It
comes from the Latin word <i>inter</i>, which means <i>between</i>, and the Latin
verb <i>jecto</i>, <i>to throw</i>, so it literally means <i>to throw between</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_36" title="pg 36"></a>
Some of these words imitate sounds, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bang! There goes another shot.</li>
<li>Ding-dong! There goes the first bell.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use interjections very frequently in writing on scientific
subjects that express deep thought, but you will find them often used in
poetry, fiction, oratory or any emotional writing. Therefore we have
our definition of an interjection:
</p>

<p><b id="sec_57">57.</b> <b>An interjection is an exclamatory word or phrase used to
express feeling or to imitate some sound.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_58">58.</b> Following is a list of commonly used interjections. Use them
in sentences of your own.
</p>

<ul>
<li>oh</li>
<li>hello</li>
<li>bravo</li>
<li>ahoy</li>
<li>aha</li>
<li>hurrah</li>
<li>bow wow</li>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>alas</li>
<li>hist</li>
<li>whirr</li>
<li>pshaw</li>
<li>fie</li>
<li>whoa</li>
<li>ding-dong</li>
<li>rub-a-dub</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Mark the interjections in the following sentences. Notice those
which express emotion and those which imitate sound.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Oh! Is it possible.</li>
<li>Hurrah! We have good news at last.</li>
<li>Whirr! Whirr! goes the giant machine.</li>
<li>Come! Keep up your courage.</li>
<li>What! I cannot believe it.</li>
<li>Courage! We shall yet win.</li>
<li>Bravo! Let those words ring down the centuries.</li>
<li>Ding-dong! the bells ring out the hour!</li></ol>

<h2>SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 3</h2>

<p>Since there are forty-two elementary sounds used in the formation
of our words and only twenty-six letters to represent these sounds,
some of these letters must necessarily represent more than one sound.
</p>

<p>Of the forty-two elementary sounds, eighteen are vowel sounds,
but we have only five vowels with which to represent these sounds, so
each vowel has several different sounds.
</p>

<p>Therefore we must have a key to pronunciation to indicate the
various sounds which are represented by these letters used in forming
the words. When you look up words in your dictionary you will find
the vowels marked by certain signs to indicate the pronunciation. These
signs are called diacritical marks.
</p>

<p>The following table gives the diacritical marks for the vowels.
Study this table and learn to pronounce the words you look up. When
<a class="pagenum" id="page_37" title="pg 37"></a>
you have determined the correct pronunciation of the word, repeat it
over to yourself aloud a number of times until you have accustomed
your ear to the correct pronunciation.
</p>

<p>Different dictionaries use different keys to pronunciation. This
table is taken from the dictionary which we are using in connection with
this course&mdash;Winston's New Universal Self-Pronouncing Dictionary.
</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 4</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We are studying in this lesson a most interesting part of our language,
the words that are the names of things. If we could trace these
names of things and the order and time of their coming into the
language of men we would have a progressive history of mankind. Way
back yonder in the dim dawn of history, men lived upon fruit and nuts.
They had no knowledge of the use of fire and could not use foods that
required cooking. They communicated with one another by signs. Then
they discovered fire and invented the bow and arrow. They could now
use fish and flesh for food and they commenced to use articulate speech.
This stage has been called the Middle Stage of Savagery. With the invention
of the bow and arrow, began the third stage of savagery which
merged into the first stage of barbarism with the invention of pottery.
</p>

<p>There are three stages of barbarism before we come to the beginning
of the era of civilization which begins with the use of the phonetic
alphabet and the production of literary records. All tribes that have
never attained the art of pottery are classed as savages and those who
possess this art but have never attained a phonetic alphabet and the use
of writing are classed as barbarians. Civilization began with the spoken
and written language and it has been well said that all that separates
us from savagery is a wall of books. It is upon the accumulated wisdom
of the past that we build. Without this we would be helpless.
</p>

<p>So these various names of things have come to us with developing
evolving life. As the men of the past gained a knowledge of the use
of fire, as they learned to bake the clay and make various utensils; to
heat and forge the iron into weapons; to conquer nature in all her
phases, to feed the race, to clothe the race, to shelter the race more
adequately, our language has grown in volume, strength and beauty.
</p>

<p>The study of words and their uses is of great importance to you.
Master the few rules necessary and watch your words daily. We are
living in an age full of wondrous things and yet many of us have almost
as limited a <span class="corr" title="vocabularly">vocabulary</span> as the men of those
bygone days, who had never
dreamed of the marvels that are commonplace to us.
</p>

<p>As you use your dictionary watch closely the meaning of the words
and choose the words that most aptly express your ideas. Listen to
good English spoken as often as you can. <i>Read</i> good English. Mark
the difference between good and bad English and gradually you will
find yourself using good English naturally and continually.

CLASSES OF NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_59">59.</b> We have learned that the words in a sentence are classified
according to the work which each word does. The words which assert
are called verbs; the words which are the names of things are called
nouns. But now we shall see that these words are again divided into
classes according to the <i>special</i> work which they perform. Just as we
may gather the people of the world into one great class, the working
class, then classify them according to the industry in which they work,
thus some are farmers, some teachers, some factory workers; then each
class may be subdivided according to the special work which they perform,
as truck farmers, high school teachers, machinists, etc.
</p>

<p>So we find that nouns are divided into classes according to their
meaning in the sentence.
</p>

<p>In the sentence, <i>Lincoln was a man of the people</i>, we have two nouns
referring to the same person, <i>Lincoln</i> and <i>man</i>, but they are different
kinds of names. The word <i>man</i> is a name that may apply to any one
of a million persons but the name <i>Lincoln</i> applies to one person only.
Some nouns, then, represent a thing as being of a certain kind or class,
without showing which particular one is meant. Other nouns are names
given to designate a particular individual. These are called <i>common</i>
and <i>proper</i> nouns.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_60">60.</b> <b>A proper noun is a special name meant for only one person,
place or thing.</b>
</p>

<p>All other nouns are common nouns.
</p>

<p><b>A common noun is a name which belongs to all things of a
class of objects.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Every proper noun should begin with a capital letter.</b>
</p>

<p>Indicate the proper nouns in the following list by drawing a line
under the letters that ought to be capitals:
</p>

<ul>
<li>king</li>
<li>month</li>
<li>city</li>
<li>france</li>
<li>dog</li>
<li>virginia</li>
<li>war</li>
<li>wilson</li>
<li>november</li>
<li>doctor</li>
<li>colonel</li>
<li>napoleon</li>
<li>chicago</li>
<li>governor</li>
<li>independence day</li>
<li>freedom</li>
<li>ocean</li>
<li>atlantic ocean</li>

<li>union</li>
<li>labor</li>
<li>united mine workers</li>

</ul>

<p>Write the special or <i>proper</i> names of several individuals in each
of the following classes:&mdash;as city,&mdash;Chicago, New York, etc.
</p>

<p>River, king, author, country, state, inventor, martyr, month, book,
college.
</p>

<h3>COLLECTIVE NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_61">61.</b> Some nouns are the names of groups or collections of things
and are called collective nouns.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_40" title="pg 40"></a>
Many soldiers taken together form collectively an <i>army</i>&mdash;a number
of sheep form a <i>drove</i>. Many of these group or collective nouns
will readily occur to your mind.
</p>

<p><b>A collective noun is one that in the singular form, denotes a
number of separate persons or things.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Opposite each of the following collective nouns, write the name of
the individuals represented by the collection; as an army of
<i>soldiers</i>; a swarm of <i>bees</i>; a flock of <i>birds</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>A gang of.......</li>
<li>A committee of.......</li>
<li>A herd of.......</li>
<li>A drove of.......</li>
<li>A hive of.......</li>
<li>A corps of.......</li>
<li>A suite of.......</li>
<li>A group of.......</li>
<li>A class of.......</li>
<li>A multitude of.......</li>
</ul>

<p>Fill the following blanks with appropriate collective nouns.</p>

<ul>
<li>A......of horses.</li>
<li>A......of sailors.</li>
<li>A......of wolves.</li>
<li>A......of savages.</li>
<li>A......of singers.</li>
<li>A......of girls.</li>
<li>A......of ships.</li>
<li>A......of quail.</li>
<li>A......of birds.</li>
<li>A......of workers.</li>
</ul>


<h3>ABSTRACT NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_62">62.</b> When primitive man began to name the objects about him,
doubtless he first named the things which he could see, hear, taste,
smell and touch,&mdash;the objects which he could perceive by the five
senses. Then gradually he came to understand that these objects had certain
qualities which he could consider apart from the object itself.
</p>

<p>He hunted among the stones to find those which were suitable for
making his arrow-heads. For this purpose he needed the hardest stone
which he could find, so <i>hardness</i> became something which he could
think of as something apart from the object itself.
</p>

<p>He saw the men about him and found a name for them. Then he
knew that some men were stronger than others, so <i>strength</i> was a
quality  which he could consider apart from the man himself.
</p>

<p>These men performed certain actions; they ran, they climbed,&mdash;so
<i>running</i> and <i>climbing</i> became actions which he could think
of as something apart from any individual.
</p>

<p>He noted too that men lived in certain conditions; for example,
some men were free, some were slaves, so he came to think of
<i>slavery</i> and <i>freedom</i> as conditions which could be thought of as something
apart from the individual.
</p>

<p>So we draw away, or separate certain ideas; the <i>quality</i> from the
thing which has it and the <i>action</i> from the thing which does it
and the <i>condition</i> from the thing which is in it. These nouns which are
used to describe these qualities, actions or conditions are called
<i>abstract</i> nouns. Abstract is a word derived from the Latin <i>abs</i>, <i>away from</i>,
and <i>tractus</i>, <i>drawn</i>, so it literally means <i>drawn away from</i>.
</p>

<p>The nouns which are names of things which we can see, hear, taste,
smell and touch or perceive by any of the five senses are called
<i>concrete</i> nouns.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_41" title="pg 41"></a>
<b id="sec_63">63.</b> <b>A concrete noun is the name of an object which may be
perceived by one or more of the five senses.</b>
</p>

<p><b>An abstract noun is the name of a quality, a condition or an
action.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_64">64.</b> You remember we found in the study of adjectives that we
have a class of adjectives which are used to describe the qualities of
objects, as for example&mdash;<i>good</i>, <i>noble</i>, <i>honest</i>,
<i>true</i>, <i>wise</i>, etc. Since
abstract nouns are the names of qualities, many of our abstract nouns
are formed from adjectives. Study carefully the following list of
adjectives
and nouns. Note that the word is an <i>adjective</i> when it is used
with a noun to <i>describe</i> certain qualities. It is a <i>noun</i>
when it is used
by itself to <i>name</i> that quality.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Adjectives</th>    <th>Abstract Nouns</th></tr>
<tr><td>1.</td> <td>honest</td>      <td>honesty</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td> <td>pure</td>        <td>purity</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td> <td>true</td>        <td>truth</td></tr>

<tr><td>11.</td> <td>patient</td>     <td>patience</td></tr>
<tr><td>12.</td> <td>stupid</td>      <td>stupidity</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_65">65.</b> You will notice that another use of abstract nouns is to name
actions. The verb is the part of speech which expresses action,
therefore
many abstract nouns are formed from verbs. Notice the following
list:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Verbs</th>      <th>Abstract Nouns</th></tr>
<tr><td>1.</td> <td>learn</td>    <td>learning</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td> <td>invent</td>   <td>invention</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td> <td>choose</td>   <td>choice</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td> <td>defend</td>   <td>defense</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td> <td>try</td>      <td>trial</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.</td> <td>judge</td>    <td>judgment</td></tr>
<tr><td>7.</td> <td>read</td>     <td>reading</td></tr>
<tr><td>8.</td> <td>please</td>   <td>pleasure</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.</td> <td>elect</td>    <td>election</td></tr>
<tr><td>10.</td> <td>move</td>     <td>motion</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_66">66.</b> An abstract noun is also the name of a condition. These
nouns are derived from the concrete noun which is the name <span class="corr" title="of person">of the person</span> or thing which is <i>in</i> the condition.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Concrete Nouns</th><th>Abstract Nouns</th></tr>
<tr><td>1.</td> <td>slave</td>          <td>slavery</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td> <td>friend</td>         <td>friendship</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td> <td>thief</td>          <td>theft</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td> <td>man</td>            <td>manhood</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td> <td>child</td>          <td>childhood</td></tr>

<tr><td>8. </td><td>martyr</td>         <td>martyrdom</td></tr>
</table>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_42" title="pg 42"></a>
NUMBER FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_67">67.</b> So we find that we classify our nouns according to the special
work which they do. Now sometimes we find it necessary to change
the form of the noun to make it express our thought. Thus we say,
<i>book</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>boy</i>, <i>knife</i>, when we wish to
express the idea of only one of
each object mentioned. But when we wish to express the idea of more
than one of them, we say, <i>books</i>, <i>men</i>, <i>boys</i>, <i>knives</i>.
</p>

<p>We say, <i>The boy calls</i>; <i>the boys call</i>. The form of the noun
<i>boy</i> is changed by adding an <i>s</i> to it. The meaning has also changed.
<i>Boy</i> denotes one lad; <i>boys</i> denotes two or more lads. Any change in
form and meaning of words is called <i>inflection</i>. The change to denote
more than one object is called <i>number</i>. The word <i>boy</i>, denoting
<i>one</i> is in the <i>singular number</i>; the word <i>boys</i>, denoting <i>more than
one</i> is in the <i>plural number</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_68">68.</b> <b>Inflection is a change in the form of a word to denote a
different application or use.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Number is the form of a noun which shows whether it denotes
one or more than one.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The singular number denotes one thing.</b>
</p>
<p><b>The plural number denotes more than one thing.</b></p>

<p>There are a few rules governing the formation of plurals which we
must know, and these rules are of great assistance in correct spelling.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_69">69.</b> Most nouns form their plural by adding <i>s</i>&mdash;thus:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>boat</td>
<td>day</td>
<td>book</td>
<td>boy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>boats</td>
<td>days</td>
<td>books</td>
<td>boys</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Long ago in early English all plurals were formed by adding <i>es</i>,
and you will read in the first translation of the Bible, for instance, such
words as <i>bird-es</i>, <i>cloud-es</i>. Later the <i>e</i> was dropped
and <i>s</i> added to the
singular without an increase of syllables. But when the singular ends
in an <i>s</i> sound, the original syllable <i>es</i> is retained, for
two hissing sounds will not unite.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_70">70.</b> So nouns ending in <i>s</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>sh</i> or
soft <i>ch</i>, form the plural by adding
<i>es</i> to the singular. These words end with a sound so much like that
of <i>s</i> that we cannot pronounce the plural easily without making
another syllable. Thus:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>class</td>    <td>tax</td>      <td>topaz</td>    <td>wish</td>     <td>ditch</td></tr>
<tr><td>classes</td>  <td>taxes</td>    <td>topazes</td>  <td>wishes</td>   <td>ditches</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_71">71.</b> In words ending with the <i>s</i> sound but with a final
<i>e</i>, only <i>s</i>
is added to form the plural, but in pronouncing the word we then have
two syllables, thus:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>house</td>    <td>place</td>    <td>size</td>     <td>cage</td>     <td>niche</td></tr>
<tr><td>houses</td>   <td>places</td>   <td>sizes</td>    <td>cages</td>    <td>niches</td></tr>
</table>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_43" title="pg 43"></a>
<b id="sec_72">72.</b> Letters, figures, signs, etc., are made plural by adding an
apostrophe and the letter <i>s</i> ('s), thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross your t's and dot your i's.</li>
<li>Do you know the table of 4's?</li>
</ul>

<p>While most of our nouns form their plural in this regular way by
adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>, there are some nouns that form their
plural by some other change in the form of the word.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_73">73.</b> Notice the following list of words and their plurals:</p>

<ul>
<li>fly</li>
<li>flies</li>
<li>city</li>
<li>cities</li>
<li>key</li>
<li>keys</li>
<li>day</li>
<li>days</li>
<li>story</li>
<li>stories</li>
<li>enemy</li>
<li>enemies</li>
<li>tray</li>
<li>trays</li>
<li>boy</li>
<li>boys</li>
</ul>

<p>These nouns all end in <i>y</i>, yet they form the plural differently.
Some simply add <i>s</i> and the rest change the <i>y</i> to <i>i</i>
and add <i>es</i>. Can you discover the reason?
</p>

<p>Wherever the <i>y</i> is preceded by a vowel, as <i>e</i> in <i>key</i>,
<i>a</i> in <i>tray</i>, <i>o</i> in
<i>boy</i>, the plural is formed by adding <i>s</i>. But when the
<i>y</i> is preceded by a
consonant, as <i>l</i> in <i>fly</i>, <i>r</i> in <i>story</i>, <i>t</i>
in <i>city</i>, and <i>m</i> in <i>enemy</i>, the <i>y</i> is
changed to <i>i</i> and <i>es</i> added in forming the plural.
</p>

<p><b>If the singular ends in</b> <i>y</i> <b>after a consonant, change</b>
<i>y</i> <b>to</b> <i>i</i> <b>and
add</b> <i>es</i> <b>in the plural.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_74">74.</b> There are thirteen nouns ending in <i>f</i> and three in
<i>fe</i> which form the plural in <i>ves</i>. They are:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>beef</td>      <td>beeves</td></tr>
<tr><td>calf</td>      <td>calves</td></tr>
<tr><td>elf</td>       <td>elves</td></tr>
<tr><td>half</td>      <td>halves</td></tr>
<tr><td>leaf</td>      <td>leaves</td></tr>
<tr><td>loaf</td>      <td>loaves</td></tr>

<tr><td>knife</td>     <td>knives</td></tr>
<tr><td>life</td>      <td>lives</td></tr>
<tr><td>wife</td>      <td>wives</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All other nouns in <i>f</i> or <i>fe</i> are regular; adding only
<i>s</i>, to form the plural.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_75">75.</b> About forty nouns ending in <i>o</i> after a consonant form
the plural in <i>es</i>. The most common ones are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>buffalo</li>
<li>cargo</li>
<li>potato</li>
<li>tomato</li>
<li>negro</li>

<li>motto</li>
<li>tornado</li>
<li>volcano</li>
<li>torpedo</li>
<li>flamingo</li>
</ul>

<p>Most nouns ending in <i>o</i> form the plural regularly, adding only
<i>s</i>, as <i>pianos</i>, <i>banjos</i>, <i>cameos</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_76">76.</b> A few words form their plurals by a change in the word and
without adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>.</p>

<p>
The most common of these words are:<a class="pagenum" id="page_44" title="pg 44"></a>
</p>

<table>

<tr><td>child</td>    <td>children</td></tr>
<tr><td>louse</td>    <td>lice</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_77">77.</b> Proper nouns, when made plural, generally follow the same
rule as common nouns. Thus we write:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All the Smiths, the Joneses, both the Miss Johnsons, one of the Dr.
Davidsons, and the Mrs. Wilsons, were present.</li>
</ul>

<p>But to prevent the confusion and misunderstanding which might
arise in changing the form of a proper noun, we do not change its form
in writing the plurals; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>There were eight Henrys, kings of England.</li>
<li>The two Marys reigned in the kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be confusing to say <i>eight Henries</i>, the <i>two
Maries</i>.</p>

<p>The title is made plural when several are referred to, thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Mr. <span class="corr" title="Hays">Hayes</span></td>         <td>The Messrs. Hayes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Miss Smith</td>       <td>The Misses Smith</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_78">78.</b> The title is made plural when used with several names, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Messrs. Brown and White.</li>
<li>Generals Lee and Grant.</li>
<li>Drs. Long and Larson.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_79">79.</b> In the case of nouns formed of two or more words, when the
compound word is so familiar that the parts are not thought of
separately the <i>s</i> is added to the whole compound word, as
<i>four-in-hands</i>; <i>forget-me-nots</i>; <i>court-yards</i>; <i>spoonfuls</i>;
<i>green-houses</i>; etc. But when
one of the parts is more important than the others, the <i>s</i> is

<p><b id="sec_80">80.</b> We have many words in our language taken from other

</table>


<p><b id="sec_81">81.</b> The following nouns are treated as singular: <i>news</i>,
<i>pains</i>
(meaning care), <i>acoustics</i>, <i>mathematics</i>, <i>economics</i>,
<i>ethics</i>, <i>molasses</i>,
<i>physics</i>, <i>politics</i>, and other nouns ending in <i>ics</i>
except <i>athletics</i>. With
these always use the s-form of the verb. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The news <i>is</i> distorted. Not, The news <i>are</i> distorted.</li>
<li>Economics <i>is</i> an important study. Not, Economics <i>are</i>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_82">82.</b> The following nouns are always plural:</p>

<ul>
<li>alms</li>
<li>annals</li>
<li>amends</li>
<li>antipodes</li>
<li>bellows</li>
<li>billiards</li>

<li>tongs</li>
<li>trousers</li>
<li>vitals</li>
<li>victuals</li>
<li>vespers</li>
</ul>

<p>With all these nouns always use the form of the verb which is used
with the plural subject. Thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Alms are given.</li>
<li>Riches are easily lost.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_83">83.</b> The following nouns have the same form for both plural and
singular, <i>corps</i>, <i>cannon</i>, <i>deer</i>, <i>grouse</i>,
<i>heathen</i>, <i>hose</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>odds</i>, <i>series</i>,
<i>sheep</i>, <i>species</i>, <i>swine</i>, <i>vermin</i>, <i>wages</i>.
You can tell whether the singular
or plural is meant by the meaning of the sentence. For example:</p>

<p><i>The cannon is loaded.</i> Here we are speaking of <i>one</i> cannon.
</p>

<p><i>The cannon used in the war are of tremendous size.</i> Here we know
are meant all the big guns used in the war.
</p>

<p>When you say, <i>The sheep is lost</i>, we know you mean <i>one</i> sheep,
but when you say, <i>The sheep are in the pasture</i>, we know you mean
the entire drove.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_84">84.</b> When preceded by a numeral, the following nouns have the
same form for both singular and plural. Without the numerals, the
plural is formed by the adding of <i>s</i>; <i>brace</i>, <i>couple</i>,
<i>dozen</i>, <i>hundred</i>, <i>pair</i>,
<i>score</i>, <i>thousand</i>, <i>yoke</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Thousands enlisted.</li>
<li>Three thousand enlisted.</li>
<li>Dozens came at my call.</li>
<li>Two dozen came when I called.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_46" title="pg 46"></a>
GENDER</h3>

<p><b id="sec_85">85.</b> All of the changes we have studied so far have been for the
purpose of indicating number; but among the nouns that name living
beings, many change to show to which sex the object named belongs.
These nouns change in form to distinguish between the masculine and
the feminine. This is called <i>gender</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Gender is the distinction in words that denotes sex.</b></p>

<p><b>The nouns that denote females are called feminine nouns.</b></p>

<p><b>The nouns that denote males are called masculine nouns.</b></p>

<p>
<b id="sec_86">86.</b> The feminine form is generally made by the addition of
<i>ess</i> to the masculine form. Thus:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>prince</td>     <td>princess</td></tr>
<tr><td>master</td>     <td>mistress</td></tr>
<tr><td>host</td>       <td>hostess</td></tr>
<tr><td>count</td>      <td>countess</td></tr>
<tr><td>tiger</td>      <td>tigress</td></tr>
<tr><td>lion</td>       <td>lioness</td></tr>
<tr><td>actor</td>      <td>actress</td></tr>
<tr><td>god</td>        <td>goddess</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<b id="sec_87">87.</b> Names of things without sex are, of course, of neither
gender, and are called <i>neuter nouns</i>. Neuter means literally
<i>neither</i>. Such nouns
as <i>mountain</i>, <i>iron</i>, <i>river</i>, <i>chair</i>, are neuter.
</p>

<p>Sometimes the feminine is an entirely different word from the
masculine. Thus:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>king</td>      <td>queen</td></tr>
<tr><td>lord</td>      <td>lady</td></tr>
<tr><td>man</td>       <td>woman</td></tr>
<tr><td>youth</td>     <td>maiden</td></tr>
<tr><td>sir</td>       <td>madam</td></tr>
<tr><td>stag</td>      <td>hind</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_88">88.</b> Many nouns that denote living beings apply alike to male and
female, and are said to be of <i>common gender</i>. As woman enters more
and more into the business world and pursues the same occupations as
man, the change in form to denote the feminine is used less frequently,
and what we have called the masculine form is used for both sexes,
thus:
</p>

<p><i>Poet</i>, <i>waiter</i>, <i>doctor</i>, <i>editor</i>&mdash;these nouns
are used for both men and women.
</p>

<h3>POSSESSIVE FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_89">89.</b> There is just one more change made in the form of a noun, and
that is when we wish to show who or what owns or possesses a thing.
Thus we write:
</p>

<ul>
<li>John's book.</li>
<li>The boy's hat.</li>
</ul>

<p>And since this form of the noun denotes possession, it is called the
<i>possessive form</i>. Some grammarians call this the possessive case.
</p>

<p>The possessive form of nouns is made by adding an apostrophe
and <i>s</i>, ('s); thus, <i>day's</i>, <i>lady's</i>, <i>girl's</i>,
<i>clerk's</i>.
</p>

<p>To plural nouns ending in <i>s</i> add only an apostrophe; thus,
<i>days'</i>, <i>ladies'</i>, <i>girls'</i>, <i>clerks'</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_47" title="pg 47"></a>
When plural nouns do not end in <i>s</i>, their possessive forms are made
by adding the apostrophe and <i>s</i>, the same as singular nouns, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>They make <i>men's</i> and <i>women's</i> shoes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_90">90.</b> In words which end with a sound that resembles that of
<i>s</i>, the apostrophe with <i>s</i> forms an additional syllable. Thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>James's (pronounced James-ez.)</li>
<li>Mr. Lynch's (pronounced Lynch-ez.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only exception to the rule occurs when the addition of another
<i>s</i> would make too many hissing sounds, then we add the apostrophe
alone. Thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>For goodness' sake.</li>
<li>In Jesus' name.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_91">91.</b> In forming the possessive of compound nouns, the possessive
sign is always placed at the end, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>My son-in-law's sister.</li>
<li>The man-of-war's cannon.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_92">92.</b> When we wish to show that a thing belongs to two or more
persons who are joint owners of it, we add the possessive sign to the
last word only, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Carson, Price and Scott's store.</li>
<li>Mason and Hamlin's pianos.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is a separate ownership that we wish to denote, we place the
possessive sign after each name, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring me John's and Mary's books.</li>
<li>Lee's and Grant's armies met in battle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that the noun has just <i>three</i> changes in form, one for
the plural number, one to denote gender and one for the possessive
form. Watch carefully your own language and that of your friends
and note if these changes are correctly made.
</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 4</h2>

<p>
Some of our consonants also have more than one sound. We have
also certain combinations of consonants which represent one sound. This
combination of two letters to represent one sound is called a digraph, as
<i>gh</i>, in <i>cough</i>, <i>ch</i> in <i>church</i>. A digraph may
either be a combination of
two consonants or of two vowels or of a vowel and a consonant. The
following table contains the consonants which have more than one sound:
</p>

<ul>
<li>c&mdash;k as in <i>cat</i></li>
<li>c&mdash;s as in <i>vice</i></li>
<li>g&mdash;j as in <i>ginger</i></li>
<li>g&mdash;<i>hard</i> as in <i>go</i></li>
<li>s&mdash;sh as in <i>sure</i></li>
<li>s&mdash;zh as in <i>usual</i></li>
<li>s&mdash;<i>soft</i> as in <i>also</i></li>
<li>s&mdash;z as in <i>does</i></li>
<li>x&mdash;<i>soft</i> as in <i>extra</i></li>
<li>x&mdash;gz as in <i>exist</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The following table gives the digraphs most commonly used:</p>

<ul>
<li>ng&mdash;as in <i>ring</i>, <i>tongue</i></li>
<li>ch&mdash;as in <i>church</i> and <i>much</i></li>
<li>ch&mdash;k as in <i>chasm</i></li>
<li>ch&mdash;sh as in <i>chagrin</i></li>
<li>th&mdash;as in <i>then</i>, <i>those</i></li>
<li>th&mdash;as in <i>thin</i> and <i>worth</i></li>
<li>ce&mdash;sh as in <i>ocean</i></li>
<li>ci&mdash;sh as in <i>special</i></li>
<li>dg&mdash;j as in <i>edge</i></li>
<li>gh&mdash;f as in <i>rough</i></li>
<li>ph&mdash;f as in <i>sylph</i></li>
<li>qu&mdash;kw as in <i>quart</i></li>
<li>qu&mdash;k as in <i>conquer</i></li>
<li>sh&mdash;as in <i>shall</i></li>
<li>si&mdash;sh as in <i>tension</i></li>
<li>si&mdash;zh as in <i>vision</i></li>
<li>ti&mdash;sh as in <i>motion</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
The use of these digraphs gives us a number of additional sounds.
Notice the use of the consonants which have more than one sound
and also the digraphs in the spelling lesson for the week. Mark the
consonants and digraphs.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 5</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We want to say just a word about the lesson assignment. This
has been arranged on a schedule of days merely to assist you in
systematizing
your time and making the most of the leisure at your disposal.
It is not intended that you should slavishly follow it. We thoroughly
believe in individuality and all that contributes toward its
development.
But we are also confident that many foolish things are done in the
name of liberty. Whenever we set ourselves to the performance of any
task we necessarily limit our activities in some other direction. Power
comes by concentration of force. Whenever we combine with others for
the accomplishment of any purpose, it becomes necessary to have some
plan of action and we give and take for the end which we have in view.
The musician because he follows the law of harmony in music has not
given up his liberty. He has only found a new freedom which enables
him to make glorious music where only discord reigned before. System
in our work does not mean loss of liberty or of individuality but only
finding a channel through which individuality can flow into the great
ocean of real freedom.
</p>

<p>So use this suggestive lesson assignment to meet your own need
and find expression for your real individuality in full freedom.
</p>

<p>This is the first of several lessons concerning verbs. The verb is
perhaps the most difficult part of speech to thoroughly master, so do
not be discouraged if there are some parts of this lesson you do not
understand. Succeeding lessons will clear up these difficult points.
Keep your eyes open as you read every day, and be careful of your
spelling and pronunciation.
</p>

<p>Some of us mis-spell the common words which we see and use every
day. In a student's letter we recently noted that, with our letter before
him in which the word was printed in large type and correctly spelled,
he spelled College, <i>Colledge</i>.
</p>

<p>Do not be satisfied with half-way things or less than that which is
worthy of you. Demand the best for yourself. Read aloud this little
verse from the Good Grey Poet, Walt Whitman:
</p>

<div class="poem left">
<p>"O, the joy of a manly self-hood;</p>
<p>To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or
unknown,</p>
<p>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,</p>
<p>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,</p>
<p>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,</p>
<p>To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the
earth."</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_51" title="pg 51"></a>
THE WORD THAT ASSERTS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_93">93.</b> You remember when we studied sentences we found that we
could not have a sentence without a verb or a word that asserts. The
life of a sentence is the verb, for without the verb we cannot assert,
question or command. It was on account of this importance that the
Romans called the verb, <i>verbum</i>, which meant the word. Verbs, like
nouns, are divided into classes.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_94">94.</b> In some of our sentences the verb alone is enough to make a
complete assertion, but in other sentences we use verbs that need to
be followed by one or more words to complete the assertion. Notice
the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The boy ran.</li>
<li>The boy found the ball.</li>
<li>The earth revolves.</li>
<li>The earth is round.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you notice any difference in the verbs used in these sentences?
Notice that the verbs <i>ran</i> and <i>revolves</i> make the complete
assertion about their subjects. Notice the verbs <i>found</i> and <i>is</i>. These are
not complete without the addition of the words <i>ball</i> and <i>round</i>. If we
say <i>The boy found</i>, <i>The earth is</i>, you at once ask, <i>The boy found
WHAT?</i> <i>The earth is WHAT?</i> The sense is incomplete without the addition of these
words <i>ball</i> and <i>round</i>. A part of the thought is
unexpressed; but when we say <i>The boy found the ball</i>, <i>The earth is round</i>, the
sense is complete.
</p>

<p>So we have two classes of verbs, <i>COMPLETE AND INCOMPLETE
VERBS</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_95">95.</b> <b>An incomplete verb is one that requires the addition of
one or more words to complete its meaning.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The word or words added to an incomplete verb to complete
its meaning are called the complement.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A complete verb is one that requires no complement to complete
its meaning.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_96">96.</b> You can readily tell when a verb is complete and when it is
incomplete by asking the question <i>What?</i> If you put the question
<i>what</i> after the verb, and it makes a sensible question the verb is
<i>incomplete</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Farmers raise&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
<li>The employer discharged&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
<li>We were&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
<li>The earth is&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>If the question <i>what?</i> does not make sense after the verb, then
the verb is <i>complete</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The sun shines.</li>
<li>Water flows.</li>
<li>Men work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question <i>what</i> after these verbs would not make sense, as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sun shines&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
<li>Men work&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
<li>Water flows&mdash;<i>what?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>So these verbs are <i>complete</i> verbs.</p>

<p><b id="sec_97">97.</b> The same verb, however, may be complete or incomplete,
according to the way in which it is used. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The corn grows.</li>
<li>The farmer grows corn.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_52" title="pg 52"></a>
In the sentence, <i>Corn grows</i>, <i>grows</i> is a complete verb. You could
not say <i>The corn grows&mdash;what?</i> for it does not grow anything. It
merely grows, and the verb <i>grows</i> in this sense is a complete verb. But
in the sentence, <i>The farmer grows corn</i>, you are using the verb <i>grows</i>
in a slightly different sense. It is an <i>incomplete verb</i>, for you do not
mean, <i>The farmer grows</i>, but you mean that <i>the farmer grows CORN</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, underscore the complete verbs with one
line, the incomplete with two lines. Ask the question <i>what?</i> after
each verb to determine whether it is complete or incomplete.
</p>

<ul>
<li>He returned today.</li>
<li>He returned the book.</li>
<li>The rose smells sweet.</li>
<li>He smelled the rose.</li>
<li>The trees shake in the wind.</li>
<li>The wind shakes the trees.</li>
<li>The ship plows through the waves.</li>
<li>The farmer plows the field.</li>
<li>The birds sing sweetly.</li>
<li>They sang the Marseillaise.</li>
<li>He worries over the matter.</li>
<li>The matters worry him.</li>
<li>The table feels rough.</li>
<li>He feels the rough surface.</li>
<li>It tastes bitter.</li>
<li>He tasted the bitter dregs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Use the following verbs in sentences as both complete and incomplete
verbs, as for example, <i>The snow melts.</i> <i>The sun melts the
snow.</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>melts</li>
<li>write</li>
<li>stopped</li>
<li>answer</li>
<li>rings</li>
<li>fall</li>
<li>see</li>
<li>strike</li>
</ul>

<h3>INCOMPLETE VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_98">98.</b> Do you notice any difference in the two verbs in the
following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The boy found the ball.</li>
<li>The earth is round.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the sentence, <i>The boy found the ball</i>, the word <i>ball</i>
tells <i>what</i> the
boy <i>found</i>. The verb <i>found</i> expresses action; it tells what
the boy <i>does</i>.
<i>Boy</i> is the subject of the action&mdash;the one who performs the
action.
The word <i>ball</i> is the <i>object</i> of the action. It shows the
receiver of the
action. In the sentence, <i>The earth is round</i>, <i>is</i> does not
express action.
The earth is not doing anything, it simply <i>is</i>. The verb <i>is</i>
expresses a
state or condition and is incomplete, for you do not know what state
or condition is expressed until we add the other word or words which
describe the state or condition.
</p>

<p>Notice the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The earth is round.</li>
<li>The earth is our home.</li>
<li>The earth is a sphere.</li>
<li>The earth is large.</li>
</ul>

<p>The words <i>round</i>, <i>sphere</i>, <i>home</i> and <i>large</i>,
describe the earth which
is the subject of the verb <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_99">99.</b> So we have two classes of incomplete verbs, the verbs that
express action and the verbs that express state or condition. The verbs
<a class="pagenum" id="page_53" title="pg 53"></a>
which express action are called <i>transitive</i> verbs. Transitive is a
word derived from the Latin, and means literally <i>passing over</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_100">100.</b>  So a transitive verb describes an action which <i>passes over</i>
from the subject to the object. As for example in the sentence, <i>The
player struck the ball</i>, <i>struck</i> is a transitive verb&mdash;a verb
of action&mdash;describing
the action of the subject, <i>player</i>, which passes over to the
object, <i>ball</i>. Therefore we have our definition of a transitive verb:
</p>

<p><b>A transitive verb is one that has a complement showing who or
what receives the action expressed by the verb.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The complement or word that denotes the receiver of the action
expressed by a transitive verb is called the object.</b>
</p>

<p>When you look up the meaning of verbs in your dictionary, you
will find some verbs marked <i>v.i.</i>, and some verbs marked
<i>v.t.</i> <i>V.t.</i> is
the abbreviation for <i>verb transitive</i>. Whenever you find a verb marked
<i>v.t.</i>, you know that it is a transitive verb, a verb of action,
one which requires an object to complete its meaning. <i>V.i.</i> is the
abbreviation for <i>verb intransitive</i>. Some grammarians use the term
<i>intransitive</i> to include
both <i>complete</i> and <i>copulative</i> verbs. We have used the terms
complete and incomplete because they are much simpler and clearer in describing
the two general classes of verbs, but you will remember that
when you find verbs marked <i>v.i.</i> in the dictionary that these
include <i>complete</i> and <i>copulative</i> verbs.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_101">101.</b>  Now notice these sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The earth is round.</li>
<li>The earth is a sphere.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the verb <i>is</i> does not express action, but <i>connects</i> or <i>couples</i> the complements <i>round</i> and <i>sphere</i> with the subject <i>earth</i>. Verbs used in this way are called <i>copulative</i> verbs, from the word <i>copula</i>, which means to <i>complete</i> or to <i>connect</i>. The words <i>round</i> and <i>sphere</i> are not the objects of the verb, for they do not describe the receiver of any action. They are the words which describe the state or condition expressed in the verb <i>is</i>, and are called the attribute complement of the verb.
</p>

<p>You note that this complement may be either an adjective or a
noun. In the sentence, <i>The earth is round</i>, the adjective,
<i>round</i>, is used
as the complement; in the sentence, <i>The earth is a sphere</i>, the
noun, <i>sphere</i>, is used as the complement. So we have our definition of
copulative verbs.</p>

<p><b id="sec_102">102.</b> <b>Verbs that express state or condition are called
copulative verbs.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The word or words that complete the meaning of an incomplete
verb expressing state or condition, are called the complement,
or attribute complement.</b>
</p>

<p>There are only a few of these copulative verbs. All forms of the
verb, <i>be</i>; like <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i> and
<i>were</i>, and the verb phrases like <i>must
be</i>, <i>can be</i>, <i>will be</i>, <i>shall be</i>, <i>have
been</i>, <i>had been</i>, etc.; and the verbs
<i>seem</i>, <i>appear</i>, <i>become</i>, <i>look</i>, <i>feel</i>,
<i>taste</i>, <i>sound</i> and <i>smell</i>, are the principal
copulative verbs.
</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_54" title="pg 54"></a>
Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following sentences. Note whether the complement
of the copulative verb is an adjective or a noun. Draw one line
under each <i>adjective</i> used as a complement and two lines under
each <i>noun</i> used as a complement.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The day is beautiful.</li>
<li>I am weary and tired.</li>
<li>The men were soldiers.</li>
<li>The tasks seem endless.</li>
<li>All men must be free.</li>
<li>The workers have been slaves.</li>
<li>The burden becomes heavier every day.</li>
<li>The children feel happy and care-free.</li>
<li>Evolution is the development of life.</li>
<li>Grammar is the study of words and their use.</li>
<li>Knowledge is freedom.</li>
<li>The music sounds sweet on the midnight air.</li>
<li>He looks well today.</li>
<li>The dregs taste bitter.</li>
<li>The incense smells sweet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Complete the following sentences by adding an object or a complement.</p>

<ol>
<li>Perseverance in your study will bring.......</li>
<li>The great need of the working class is.......</li>
<li>We shall never acknowledge.......</li>
<li>By the sweat of no other's brow shalt thou eat.......</li>

<li>An incomplete verb requires.......</li>
<li>The complement of a transitive verb is called.......</li>
<li>The complement of a copulative verb may be either......or.......</li>
</ol>

<p><b id="sec_103">103. There are two classes of verbs, complete and incomplete.</b></p>

<p><b>A complete verb is one that requires no complement.</b></p>

<p><b>An incomplete verb is one that requires a complement to complete
its meaning.</b></p>

<p><b>Incomplete verbs are of two kinds: 1. Those that express
action; 2. Those that express state or condition.</b></p>

<p><b>Incomplete verbs that express action are called transitive verbs.</b></p>

<p><b>Incomplete verbs that express state or condition are called
copulative verbs.</b>
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_55" title="pg 55"></a>
<b>The complement or the word that denotes the receiver of the
action expressed in a transitive verb is called the object.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The word or words that complete the meaning of a copulative
verb are called the complement, or attribute complement.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The same verb may be complete or incomplete, according to
the way in which it is used.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>In the following sentences draw a single line under the complete
verbs and a double line under the incomplete verbs. Then determine
whether the incomplete verbs are transitive or copulative verbs, and
draw a line through the object or the complement.
</p>

</ol>

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>In the following quotation all of the verbs are printed in <i>italics</i>.
Determine whether they are complete or incomplete verbs. If incomplete,
determine whether they are transitive or copulative verbs. Draw
a line under the object of every transitive verb and two lines under the
complement of every copulative verb. Remember that sometimes we
have several words combined into a verb phrase and used as a single
verb. Watch for the verb phrases in the following, as for example:
<i>must be</i>, in the sentence, <i>Labor must be free</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The history of man <i>is</i> simply the history of slavery. Slavery
<i>includes</i> all
other crimes. It <i>degrades</i> labor and <i>corrupts</i> leisure. With
the idea that
labor <i>is</i> the basis of progress <i>goes</i> the truth that labor
<i>must be</i> free. The
laborer <i>must be</i> a free man.</p>

<p>There <i>is</i> something wrong in a government where honesty
<i>wears</i> a rag and
rascality <i>dons</i> a robe; where the loving <i>eat</i> a crust while
the infamous <i>sit</i> at
banquets.</p>

<p><i>Talk</i> about equal opportunity! Capitalism <i>ties</i> a balloon to
the shoulders
of the rich child; it <i>ties</i> a ball and chain to the feet of the
poor child;
and <i>tells</i> them that they <i>have</i> an equal opportunity!</p>

<p>Once the master <i>hunted</i> for the slaves, now the slave <i>hunts</i>
for a master.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_56" title="pg 56"></a>
Exercise 7</h4>

<p>Mark the verbs in the following poem. Often in poetry words are
omitted which in strict grammatical construction should be expressed.
As for example in the fourth line of this poem <i>which are</i>, is
omitted before
the word <i>bought</i>. In prose this would read, <i>The pews which are
bought by the profits</i>, etc. So the word <i>bought</i> is a part of
the verb
phrase, <i>are bought</i>. In the last line of the third stanza there is
another
omission before the word <i>planning</i>. The meaning is, <i>while they
are
planning slaughter</i>. <i>Planning</i> is a part of the verb phrase
<i>are planning</i>.
And in the last line <i>is</i> is omitted before the word
<i>beloved</i>. <i>Is beloved</i> is
the verb phrase. Determine whether the verbs in this poem are complete,
transitive or copulative, and mark the objects and the complements
of the transitive and the copulative verbs.</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 5</h2>

<p>We often have two vowels used in the same syllable as a single
sound, as <i>ou</i> in <i>round</i>, <i>oi</i> in <i>oil</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b>A diphthong is a union of two vowels to represent a single
sound different from that of either alone.</b>
</p>

<p>Sometimes we have two vowels used together in a combination
which is really not a diphthong for they do not unite in a different
sound.
Only one of the vowels is used and the other is silent as <i>ai</i> in
<i>rain</i>, <i>oa</i> in
<i>soap</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>The most common diphthongs are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ou as in <i>sound</i>.</li>
<li>ow as in <i>owl</i>.</li>
<li>oi as in <i>oil</i>.</li>
<li>oy as in <i>boy</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the spelling lesson for this week mark the words in which the
combination of vowels forms a diphthong. In some of the words the
combination of vowels does not form a diphthong for only one of the
vowels is sounded. Draw a line through the silent letter.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 6</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We have this week another lesson in verbs. Do not be discouraged
if you do not understand it all at once. Little by little, it will grow
clearer and you will master this important word.
</p>

<p>The verb may seem involved to you, but a little application will
soon make it clear. It is the most important word in the language
to master. It almost seems as though the verb were a living, thinking
thing. It changes outward form to accommodate itself to its subject
in the number form and person form change. If it is entertaining a
subject in the singular it adopts one dress; if it is entertaining a
plural
subject, more than one, the verb wears a different dress.
</p>

<p>So also if the subject is the first person, the person speaking, or
the second person, the person spoken to, or the third person, the person
spoken of, the verb accommodates itself to the subject. The verb is
the most agreeable thing for it changes its form to agree with its
subject!
So watch your verb and see that it agrees.
</p>

<p>Refer constantly to your list of irregular verbs given in this lesson
for we so often make mistakes in the use of these verb forms.
</p>

<p>Then, too, the verb kindly changes its form to accommodate itself
to the time of the action&mdash;action in the present, in the past, in the
future&mdash;action completed before the present time&mdash;before some time
past&mdash;or before some future time&mdash;and action progressing and not yet
completed in the present, in the past or in the future. Then it can also
change to show whether its subject is acting or being acted upon. Isn't
the verb a wonderfully accommodating member of the co-operative
commonwealth
of words?
</p>

<p>And can you not see hidden under all this, a marvelous development
in the intellectual needs of men from the day of the savage's signs and
grunts to the day when we can express such shades of meaning? This
tool of expression, language, has had a wonderful evolution side by side
with the evolution of the other tools by which man expresses his
creative
genius; from the forked stick with which man scratched the soil to the
great machine-driven plow of today; from the simple threshing flail
to the monster threshing machine of modern times.
</p>

<p>There is nothing so wonderful as man's ability to express himself.
Add a little to your knowledge every day and the sum total will soon
surprise you.
</p>

INFLECTION&mdash;CHANGES IN FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_104">104.</b> You remember that nouns have certain changes in form to
indicate changes in use. Verbs also have several changes in form to
correspond with changes in their use or meaning. Notice the following
sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I think.</li>
<li>I thought.</li>
<li>I work.</li>
<li>I worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the difference in the meaning of <i>I think</i> and <i>I
thought</i>?
of <i>I work</i> and <i>I worked</i>? When we say, <i>I think</i>, or
<i>I work</i>, we mean that
the action is now, to-day, in the present; but when we say, <i>I
thought</i>,
or <i>I worked</i>, we mean that <i>now</i> is not the time of the
action, but that
the action was performed sometime in the past. So we have a change
in the verb form to denote <i>time</i>. The simple form of the verb,
like
<i>think</i> or <i>work</i>, is used to denote <i>present time</i>. When
we wish to express
<i>past time</i> we do it by changing the form of the verb. Now note the
following:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>I, We, You, They,<br />The men</td>
<td class="longbrace2">}</td>
<td>call<br />send<br />fall<br />bring<br />hide</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>He, She, It,<br />The man</td>
<td class="longbrace2">}</td>
<td>calls<br />sends<br />falls<br />brings<br />hides</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now let us write this in another way.</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="7">Present Time</th></tr>
<tr><th colspan="4" class="sub">Singular</th>
<th colspan="3" class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td colspan="4">1st person&mdash;I call.</td>     <td colspan="3">We call.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="4">2nd person&mdash;You call. </td>    <td colspan="3">You call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3rd person</td>
<td>He<br />She<br />It<br />The man</td>
<td class="longbrace4">}</td>
<td>calls.</td>
<td>They, or<br />The men</td>
<td class="longbrace2">}</td>
<td>call.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_105">105.</b> You notice in this table we use the expressions <i>first person</i>,
<i>second person</i>, and <i>third person</i>. <i>I</i> and <i>we</i>
indicate the person or persons speaking and are called the first person. <i>You</i> indicates the person or persons spoken to and is called the second person. <i>He</i>,
<i>she</i>, <i>it</i>, <i>they</i>,
and the person or persons or things spoken of, are called the third person.
</p>

<p>We use the word <i>you</i> when speaking to one or more than one now-a-days.
It used to be that when speaking to a single person, people said
<i>thou</i>, and in speaking to two or more they said <i>you</i>. But we today have
dropped the old form <i>thou</i>, and use <i>you</i> for both singular and plural.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_60" title="pg 60"></a>
<b id="sec_106">106.</b> Now note, in the above table, that there is only one form
change in the verb, and this is in the <i>third person singular</i>. We say
<i>I call</i>, <i>You call</i>, <i>We call</i>, <i>They</i>, or <i>The
men call</i>, but we say <i>He</i>, or <i>the
man calls</i>, in speaking of one person or thing. So we change the form
of the verb with any subject which denotes the third person and the
singular number. This form is made by adding <i>s</i> to the simple form of
the verb, therefore we may call it the <i>s-form</i> because it always ends in <i>s</i>.
</p>

<p>Remember that this <i>s-form</i> is used to express present time with a
third person, singular subject. <i>BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE THIS
FORM WITH ANY PLURAL SUBJECT.</i> There is no other change
in the verb form in expressing the present time in any verb, except in
the verb <i>be</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_107">107.</b> This little verb <i>be</i> is one of the most troublesome verbs in our
language, and since it is used in forming verb phrases, it will be well to
commit the following table to memory. Watch closely your use of this
bothersome little word. Note that it has a change in form for the
<i>first person singular</i>, as well as for the third person singular. All other
verbs have just the one change, the <i>s-form</i> for the third person singular.
The verb <i>be</i> has a form also to use with the first person singular, the
pronoun <i>I</i>.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Present Time</th>        <th>Past Time</th></tr>
<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>    <th class="sub">Singular</th></tr>

</table>

<p><b id="sec_108">108.</b> <b>The present time form is the form which expresses present
time. It is expressed by the simple form of the verb with the exception
of the third person singular, which is expressed by the</b>
<i>s-form</i>.
</p>

<h3>PAST TIME</h3>

<p><b id="sec_109">109.</b> To express <i>past time</i> we change the form of the verb.
Notice the following:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>I<br />She<br />He<br />It<br />The man</td>
<td class="longbrace5">}</td>
<td>called<br />sent<br />fell<br />brought<br />hid</td>
<td>We<br />You<br />They<br />The men</td>
<td class="longbrace5">}</td>
<td>called<br />sent<br />fell<br />brought<br />hid</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that these various forms of the verb which express past time
are all made by changes from the simple form, which expresses present
time. You will also notice that these five verbs used in the above table
all form their past time form in different ways. For example,
<i>call</i> adds
<i>ed</i>; <i>send</i> changes the final letter from <i>d</i> to
<i>t</i>; <i>fall</i> changes the vowel in the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_61" title="pg 61"></a>
middle of the word from <i>a</i> to <i>e</i>; <i>bring</i> changes both
the vowel and the
final letter from <i>bring</i> to <i>brought</i>; <i>hide</i> drops the
final letter <i>e</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_110">110.</b> <b>Verbs whose past time forms are made by adding</b>
<i>d</i> <b>or</b>
<i>ed</i> <b>to the simple form are called regular verbs.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Verbs whose past time forms are made in some other way than
by adding</b> <i>d</i> <b>or</b> <i>ed</i> <b>are called irregular
verbs.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_111">111.</b> There are about two hundred of these irregular verbs which
form their past time in the following ways:
</p>

<p>1. By change in the vowel letter, as <i>fall</i>, <i>fell</i>;
<i>write</i>, <i>wrote</i>; <i>see</i>,
<i>saw</i>; <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>; <i>come</i>, <i>came</i>.

</p>

<p>There are some irregular forms which we must learn and be exceedingly
careful in their use. Study the list in this lesson.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Write the <i>present</i> and <i>past</i> time forms of the following
verbs as the verb <i>think</i> is written in the table given below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>think</li>
<li>ride</li>
<li>have</li>
<li>give</li>
<li>write</li>
<li>ask</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>try</li>
<li>speak</li>
<li>run</li>
<li>see</li>
<li>do</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tr><th>Present Time</th>       <th>Past Time</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>       <th class="sub">Singular</th></tr>

<tr><td>1. I think</td>          <td>1. I thought</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. You think </td>       <td>2. You thought</td></tr>

</table>

<p><b id="sec_112">112.</b> Be very careful not to use the <i>s-form</i> except for the
third person singular. Be especially careful in the use of different forms
of the verb <i>be</i>. It is in the use of this verb that we so
frequently make mistakes.  Watch your own language and the conversation of your
friends and note these mistakes and correct them in your own mind.
These common blunders in the use of English mark us as careless or
uneducated by everyone who hears us speak. We have fallen into bad
habits oftentimes and make these mistakes when we know better, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_62" title="pg 62"></a>
only constant watchfulness for a time can overcome the habit. After
a time we learn to speak correctly without effort, and then these
mistakes made by others offend the ear like a false note in music.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Cross out the wrong form in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>They <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> not here.</li>
<li>The clouds <i>has</i>&mdash;<i>have</i> gathered.</li>
<li>People <i>is</i>&mdash;<i>are</i> indifferent.</li>
<li>The train <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> on time.</li>
<li>The men <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> armed.</li>
<li>Our school building <i>is</i>&mdash;<i>are</i> inadequate.</li>
<li>The workers <i>earn</i>&mdash;<i>earns</i> their wages.</li>
<li>The voters <i>elect</i>&mdash;<i>elects</i> the President.</li>
<li>They <i>do</i>&mdash;<i>does</i> as they please.</li>
<li>We <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> there on time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DOING DOUBLE WORK</h3>

<p><b id="sec_113">113.</b> We have found now three forms of the verb, the <i>simple
form</i>, the <i>s-form</i>, and the <i>past time form</i>, and, in addition, the
<i>I-form</i>, or the
first person form of the verb <i>be</i>. There are no other real verb
forms, but there are two other changes made in the form of the verb when it
ceases to be used as the predicate, the asserting word of the sentence,
and becomes, in part, another part of speech.
</p>

<p>Notice in the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making shoes is his work.</li>
<li>He enjoys making shoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these sentences the word <i>making</i>, from the verb <i>make</i>,
is used as a noun. In the first, <i>Making shoes is his work</i>,
<i>making</i> is used as the subject of the sentence. In the second, <i>He enjoys making
shoes</i>, <i>making</i> is used as the object of the verb <i>enjoys</i>. But
<i>making</i> is not like the ordinary noun, for it has an object
<i>making</i>&mdash;<i>what?</i>&mdash;<i>making shoes</i>.
<i>Shoes</i> is the object of the action expressed in <i>making</i>. A
noun never takes an object; so while the word <i>making</i> is used as a noun, it is also
partly a verb. It is a form of the verb used as a noun, but keeping in part
its verb nature, partaking of the nature of two parts of speech at the same time.
</p>

<p>Hence these forms of the verb are called <i>participles</i>. Participle
means <i>partaker</i>.
</p>

<p>The participle may also be used as an adjective. Notice the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>crying</i> child came toward us.</li>
<li>The <i>rescuing</i> party arrived.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences <i>crying</i> and <i>rescuing</i> are formed from the verbs
<i>cry</i> and <i>rescue</i>, and are used as adjectives to describe the
noun <i>child</i> and the noun <i>party</i>. So a participle is a mixed part of speech. It
is partially a verb, but is not a true verb. A true verb is always used as
the predicate, the asserting word in the sentence and <i>always</i> has a subject.
The participle <i>never</i> has a subject; it may have an object, but not
a subject.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_63" title="pg 63"></a>
<b id="sec_114">114.</b> There are two forms of the participle. The active form or the
present form as it is sometimes called, ends in <i>ing</i>, as,
<i>waiting</i>, <i>walking</i>,
<i>saying</i>. It expresses action, existence, or possession as going on at
the time mentioned in the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_115">115.</b> The other form of the participle is the passive form or the
past form of the participle. This ends in <i>ed</i> in the regular verbs, and
has various forms in the irregular verbs. It is formed in regular verbs
by adding <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i> to the simple form, hence has the same form as the
past time form, as for example, present time form, <i>call</i>&mdash;past time form,
<i>called</i>&mdash;past participle, <i>called</i>. You will find the past participle forms of irregular verbs in the list of irregular verbs given in this lesson, as
for example&mdash;present time form, <i>go</i>&mdash;past time form,
<i>went</i>&mdash;past participle, <i>gone</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_116">116.</b> You will find as we study the verb phrases in later lessons
that these participles are used in forming verb phrases. As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He is coming.</li>
<li>They are trying.</li>
<li>He has gone.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>A participle is a word derived from a verb, partaking of the
nature of a verb and also of an adjective or a noun.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Write in columns like the above the five forms of the following verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>do</li>
<li>try</li>
<li>give</li>
<li>hope</li>
<li>live</li>
<li>rob</li>
<li>have</li>
<li>think</li>
<li>sing</li>
<li>get</li>
<li>wave</li>
<li>lose</li>
<li>come</li>
<li>make</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following quotation. You will find in it all
five of the form changes of the verb&mdash;<i>the present time form</i>,
<i>the s-form</i>,
<i>the past time form</i>, <i>the present participle</i> and <i>the past
participle</i>. In the
verb phrases <i>had been filled</i>, <i>has survived</i>, <i>has
gone</i>, <i>has proved</i> and <i>be
dismayed</i>, you will find the past participle used in forming the verb
phrase. We will study these verb phrases in later lessons.
</p>

<p>In the verb phrases, <i>was stumbling</i>, <i>was groping</i>, <i>is
conquering</i>, <i>are
carrying</i>, the present participle is used in forming the verb
phrases.
<i>Could reconcile</i> is also a verb phrase. We will study these verb
phrases
also in later lessons.
</p>

<p>The present participles, <i>struggling</i>, <i>persevering</i> and
<i>regaining</i> are
used as adjectives. Study them carefully and find the words which they
describe. The present participles <i>imagining</i>, <i>learning</i> and
<i>suffering</i> are
used as nouns. Note their use.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_64" title="pg 64"></a>
The past participles <i>rebuffed</i>, <i>self-reproached</i>,
<i>discouraged</i> and
<i>promised</i> are used as adjectives. Find the words which they
modify.
There are several <i>present time forms</i>, several <i>past time
forms</i>, and several
<i>s-forms</i>. Find them and study carefully their usage.

<p class="center">OUT OF THE DARK</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Helen Keller</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>America's famous blind girl, who has come to see more than most
people with normal eyes.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Step by step my investigation of blindness <i>led</i> me into the
industrial
world. And what a world it <i>is</i>. I <i>faced</i> unflinchingly a
world of facts&mdash;a
world of misery and degradation, of blindness, crookedness, and sin, a
world
<i>struggling</i> against the elements, against the unknown, against
itself. How
<i>could</i> I <i>reconcile</i> this world of fact with the bright world
of my <i>imagining</i>?
My darkness <i>had been filled</i> with the light of intelligence, and,
<i>behold</i>, the
outer day-lit world <i>was stumbling</i>, <i>was groping</i> in social
blindness. At first, I
<i>was</i> most unhappy, but deeper study <i>restored</i> my confidence.
By <i>learning</i> the
<i>suffering</i> and burdens of men, I <i>became</i> aware as never
before of the life-power
which <i>has survived</i> the forces of darkness&mdash;the power which,
though never
completely victorious, <i>is</i> continuously <i>conquering</i>. The
very fact that we <i>are</i>
still carrying on the contest against the hosts of annihilation
<i>proves</i> that on
the whole the battle <i>has gone</i> for humanity. The world's great
heart <i>has
proved</i> equal to the prodigious undertaking which God <i>set</i> it.
<i>Rebuffed</i>, but
always <i>persevering</i>; <i>self-reproached</i>, but ever
<i>regaining</i> faith; undaunted,
tenacious, the heart of man <i>labors</i> towards immeasurably distant
goals. <i>Discouraged</i>
not by difficulties without, or the anguish of ages within, the heart
<i>listens</i> to a secret voice that <i>whispers</i>: "<i>Be</i> not
<i>dismayed</i>; in the future <i>lies</i>
the <i>Promised</i> Land."</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 6</h2>


<p>Every vowel or every vowel combination pronounced as one vowel
sound indicates a syllable (excepting final <i>e</i> in such words as
<i>fate</i>, <i>late</i>,
<i>rode</i>, etc.) Take the word <i>combination</i>, for example. In
this word
we have four syllables, thus: <i>Com-bi-na-tion</i>.
</p>

<p><b>A syllable is that part of a word which can be uttered distinctly
by a single effort of the voice.</b> Remember that each syllable must
contain a vowel or a vowel combination like <i>oi</i> or <i>ou</i>,
which is pronounced
as one vowel. Sometimes the vowel alone makes the syllable
as in <i>a-lone</i>, <i>e-qual</i>, etc. The final <i>e</i> in words
like <i>late</i>, and <i>fate</i> is not
sounded. It is silent, we say.
</p>

<p>All words ending in silent <i>e</i> have the long vowel sound, with a very
few exceptions. Words without the final <i>e</i> have the short vowel sound
as for example: <i>fate</i>, <i>fat</i>; <i>mate</i>, <i>mat</i>;
<i>hide</i>, <i>hid</i>; <i>rode</i>, <i>rod</i>.
</p>

<p>In dividing words into syllables the consonant is written with the
preceding vowel when that vowel is short. If the vowel is long the
consonant
is written with the next syllable, as for example, de-fine and
def-i-ni-tion. In de-fine the <i>e</i> is long therefore <i>f</i>, the
consonant following,
is written with the next syllable, <i>fine</i>. In def-i-ni-tion the
<i>e</i> has the
short sound, therefore the <i>f</i> is written with the <i>e</i> in the
syllable, <i>def</i>.
</p>


<p>When there are two consonants following the vowel, divide between
the consonants, as for example, <i>in-ven-tion</i>, <i>foun-da-tion</i>,
etc. Never
divide a digraph, that is, two consonants which are sounded together as
one sound, as for example, <i>moth-er</i>, <i>catch-er</i>,
<i>te-leg-ra-pher</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>In writing words containing double consonants like <i>dd</i>, <i>ll</i>,
<i>ss</i>, divide
the word into syllables between the double consonants, as for example,
<i>per-mit-ted</i>, <i>ad-mis-sion</i>, <i>sad-dest</i>, etc.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 7</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>I wonder if you have ever thought as to how our language grew.</p>

<p>We get the words in our language from many sources. The English
language today is a development of the early Anglo-Saxon. England
was called originally Angle-land which was gradually shortened into
England. So we have in our language what are called pure English or
Anglo-Saxon words. These words form the bulk of our every day
vocabulary, being simple, strong, forceful words. Then we have in
our English many foreign words which we have adopted from other
languages. There are many Latin and Greek words; these we use in
our more elegant speech or writing.
</p>

<p>There is an interesting bit written by Sir Walter Scott in his novel
of early England, "Ivanhoe," which illustrates the manner in which
words have come into our language and also the difference in speech
which marks the working class and the exploiting class. As those who
do the work of the world rid themselves of the parasites who have
appropriated
the produce of their labor, through the ages, they will demand
that which belongs to them&mdash;the best&mdash;the best in language as in
everything else.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'... I advise thee to call off Fangs and leave the herd to their
destiny, which, whether they meet with bands of traveling soldiers, or
of outlaws,
or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to be converted into
Normans before morning, to thy no small ease and comfort.'</p>

<p>"'The swine turned into Normans to my comfort!' quoth Gurth. 'Expound
that to me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull and my mind too vexed
to read riddles.'
</p>

<p>"'Why, how call you these grunting brutes running about on their four
legs?' demanded Wamba.
</p>

<p>"'Swine, fool, swine,' said the herd; 'every fool knows that.'
</p>

<p>"'And swine is good Saxon,' said the jester; 'but how call you the sow
when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung by the heels like
a traitor?'
</p>

<p>"'Pork,' answered the swineherd.
</p>

<p>"'I am glad every fool knows that too,' said Wamba; 'and pork, I think,
is good Norman-French, and so when the brute lives and is in charge of a
Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a Norman and is
called pork when she is carried to the castle-hall to feast among the
nobles.
What dost thou think of that, friend Gurth, ha?' ... "
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see even in words the distinction is made between those who
produce and those who possess.
</p>

<p>But the day is at hand when those who work shall also enjoy. We
have fought for religious and political freedom. Today we are waging
the battle for industrial freedom. It is <i>your</i> struggle.
Study&mdash;prepare
yourself to do battle for your rights.
</p>

<p class="center">Yours for Freedom,</p>

<p class="sig">THE PEOPLE'S COLLEGE.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_70" title="pg 70"></a>
FUTURE TIME</h3>

<p><b id="sec_118">118.</b> We have learned how to express present time and past time,
by changes in the form of the verb. But we very often desire to make
a statement in which we do not express either present or past time, thus
we may say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We shall enjoy our rights some day.</li>
<li>He will join us in the struggle.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not mean to say that we do enjoy our rights now, in the
present, or that we did in the past, but that we <i>shall</i> enjoy our
rights some time in the future. In the second sentence, <i>will join</i>
expresses the same idea of future time. To indicate future time, we do not make
a change in the verb form, but we use <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> with
the simple form of the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_119">119.</b> <b>We denote future time by use of a verb phrase
made by placing</b> <i>shall</i> <b>or</b> <i>will</i> <b>before the
simple form of the verb.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_120">120.</b> The rule of some grammarians is to use <i>shall</i> always
in the first person, the person speaking, to denote future time, and
<i>will</i> with
the second person, the person spoken to, and with the third person,
the person spoken of, to denote future time. But common usage does
not always follow the rules of the grammarians, and, in the course of
time, affects and changes these rules. So our common usage of today
uses <i>will</i> in the first person to express future time, as well as
<i>shall</i>.
</p>

<p>This rule of grammarians marks a nicety of speech and conveys
a distinction of meaning which it really seems worth while to retain.
The idea of the grammarians is that when we use <i>will</i> with the
first person
and <i>shall</i> with the second or third person, we express a
<i>promise</i> or
<i>determination</i>. Thus if I say, <i>I shall go</i>, I simply mean
that my going
will be in the future. But if I say, <i>I will go</i>, I either mean
that I am
promising to go or that I am expressing my determination to go. So also
if we use <i>shall</i> in the second and third persons. If we say,
<i>You will go</i>
or <i>He will go</i>, we are simply stating that the going will be in
the future,
but if we say, <i>You shall go</i>, or <i>He shall go</i>, we mean that
we promise
or are determined that you or he shall go.
</p>

<p>To be technically correct this distinction should be observed.
<i>Shall</i>
in the first person, and <i>will</i> in the second and third express
simple futurity.
<i>Will</i> in the first person and <i>shall</i> in the second and third
express
promise or determination. But in every day conversation this distinction
is not observed, and many of our best writers do not follow this rule.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Mark the future time forms in the following sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>I shall speak of liberty.</li>
<li>I will never give up.</li>
<li>I shall write to him.</li>
<li>He shall not starve.</li>
<li>We shall expect you.<a class="pagenum" id="page_71" title="pg 71"></a></li>
<li>They shall suffer for this.</li>
<li>I shall go to New York.</li>
<li>He will call for me.</li>
<li>The hungry shall be fed.</li>
<li>You will soon see the reason.</li>
<li>You shall never want for a friend.</li>
<li>They shall some day see the truth.</li>
<li>We will not fight against our class.</li>
<li>We will stand together.</li>
</ol>


<h3>PERFECT TIME</h3>

<p><b id="sec_121">121.</b> Past, present and future, being the three divisions of time,
one would naturally expect that when we had found how to express
these three forms, we would be through, but if you stop to think, you
will find that there are other verb phrases of which we have need.
</p>

<p>When we wish to speak of action as completed at the present time,
we do not say:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I study my lessons every day, <i>but</i>, I have studied my lessons
every day.</li>

<li><i>Not</i>, You work for him every day, <i>but</i>, You have worked for
him every day.</li>

<li><i>Not</i>, He sees her frequently, <i>but</i>, He has seen her
frequently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you not readily see the difference in the meaning expressed in
<i>I work every day</i>, and <i>I have worked every day</i>? In the
first sentence you express a general truth, <i>I work every day</i>, a truth which has
been true in the past, is true in the present, and the implication is that it
will continue to be true in the future. But when you say, <i>I have worked
every day</i>, you are saying nothing as to the future, but you are
describing an action which is completed at the present time. This is called the
<i>present complete</i> or <i>present perfect</i> time.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_122">122.</b> Perfect means complete, and present perfect describes an
action perfected or completed at the present time. So it is possible for
us to express a necessary shade of meaning by the present perfect time
form.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_123">123.</b> <b>The present perfect time form describes an action completed
at the present time, and is formed by using the present time
form of</b> <i>have</i> <b>and the</b> <i>past</i> <b>participle of the verb.</b>
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Present Perfect Time</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>         <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>1st. I have seen.</td>        <td>We have seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2d.  You have seen.</td>      <td>You have seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3d.  He has seen. </td>       <td>They have seen.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_124">124.</b> Review in the last lesson how to form the past participle.
Remember that it is one of the principal parts of the verb. In regular
verbs the past participle is the same form as the past time form. In
irregular verbs the past participle is quite often different from the
past time form, as for example: <i>go</i>, <i>went</i>, <i>gone</i>;
<i>do</i>, <i>did</i>, <i>done</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_72" title="pg 72"></a>
Watch closely your irregular verbs and see that you always use
the past <i>participle</i> with <i>have</i> or <i>had</i>; never use the
past <i>time</i> form with <i>have</i> or <i>had</i>.
</p>

<h3>PAST PERFECT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_125">125.</b> When you desire to express an action complete at some
definite past time, you do not say:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We finished when they came, <i>but</i>, We had finished when they came.</li>

<li><i>Not</i>, They went when we arrived, <i>but</i>, They had gone when we
arrived.</li>

<li><i>Not</i>, I worked six months when he began, <i>but</i>, I had worked
six months when he began.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you see a difference in the meaning expressed in these sentences:
<i>I worked six months when he began</i>; and <i>I had worked six
months when he began</i>? This last sentence describes an action
completed
or perfected before some definite past time.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_126">126.</b> <b>Past perfect time denotes an action perfected or
completed at some definite past time. It is formed by using</b>
<i>had</i> <b>and the past participle of the verb.</b>
</p>

<p>Remember always, with irregular verbs, to use the <i>past
participle</i>. Never use the <i>past time form</i> with <i>had</i>.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Past Perfect Time</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>         <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>1st. I had seen.</td>        <td>We had seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2d.  You had seen.</td>      <td>You had seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3d.  He had seen. </td>      <td>They had seen.</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Correct the following sentences in which the past time form is used
instead of the past participle. Look up the word in the list of
irregular
verbs and use the past participle instead of the past time form.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I have saw it often.</li>
<li>He had shook his fist.</li>
<li>She has sang for us.</li>
<li>The boat has sank here.</li>
<li>He has spoke the truth.</li>
<li>They had stole the books.</li>
<li>He has swore to the truth.</li>
<li>He had took the wrong road.</li>
<li>She has tore her dress.</li>
<li>He had threw the ball away.</li>
<li>The girl had wore the dress.</li>
<li>He had wrote the letters.</li>
<li>He had drank too much.</li>
<li>He had rode the horse.</li>
<li>The sun has rose.</li>
<li>He has bore his part.</li>
<li>They have began already.</li>
<li>The wind has blew all night.</li>
<li>It had broke when it fell.</li>
<li>He has chose the right.</li>
<li>You have did your duty.</li>
<li>He has ate his breakfast.</li>
<li>A heavy rain has fell.</li>
<li>They had gave it to me.</li>
<li>He has became rich.</li>
<li>It has grew rapidly.</li>
<li>He has knew it always.</li>
<li>He has mistook her for another.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_73" title="pg 73"></a>
FUTURE PERFECT TIME</h3>

<p><b id="sec_127">127.</b> We find also that we need a verb phrase to express time
<i>before</i> some other future time, to describe an action that will be
finished, perfected, or completed, before some other future action. Thus,
</p>
<ul>
<li>I shall have gone before you arrive.</li>
<li>You will have earned your money before you get it.</li>
<li>I shall have worked thirty days when pay-day comes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you not see a difference in saying, <i>I shall work thirty days when
pay-day comes</i>, and <i>I shall have worked thirty days when pay-day
comes</i>? The first sentence expresses simple future time, or what you will do
when pay-day comes; the second describes an action which will be
completed or perfected <i>before</i> pay-day comes. So there is quite a difference
in the meaning of the future and the future perfect time.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_128">128.</b> <b>The future perfect time form expresses or describes an
action that will be perfected or completed before some other future
time. It is formed by using</b> <i>shall have</i> <b>or</b> <i>will
have</i> <b>with the past
participle.</b>
</p>

<p>Be careful to use the past participle. Never use the past time
form with <i>shall have</i> or <i>will have</i>.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Future Perfect Time</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>          <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>1st. I shall have seen.</td>     <td>We shall have seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2d.  You will have seen.</td>    <td>You will have seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3d.  He will have seen.</td>     <td>They will have seen.</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>LET US SUM UP</h3>

<p><b id="sec_129">129.</b> We have three time forms, <i>present</i>, <i>past</i>,
<i>future</i>.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Present</th>      <th>Past</th>       <th>Future</th></tr>

<tr><td>I see</td>       <td>I saw </td>     <td> I shall see.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each of these three time forms has a <i>perfect</i> form; that is, a time
form which expresses an action as completed or perfected at the present
time, or before some definite past or future time.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Present<br />Perfect Time</th> <th>Past<br />Perfect Time</th><th>Future<br />Perfect Time</th>

<p><b id="sec_130">130.</b> It is wonderful how a knowledge of words and their uses
enables us to express so many shades of meaning. It is like our development
in observing colors. You know the savage always admires
vivid reds and greens and blues. He does not yet see the beautiful
shades and gradations of color. We enjoy the delicate pinks and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_74" title="pg 74"></a>
blues and all the varying shades between the primal seven colors of the
spectrum. And as we develop our artistic ability we see and enjoy all
the beauties of color.
</p>

<p>In music too, we observe the same development. The barbarian
enjoys loud, crashing, discordant sounds which he calls music, but which
to the educated ear are only harsh noises. The trained musician catches
the delicate overtones and undertones and finds deepest ecstasy in sounds
which the uneducated ear does not even catch. So as we study words
and their uses, we find ourselves able to express shades of meaning, to
paint our word pictures, not in gaudy, glaring chromo-tints, but in the
wondrous blending of color that reveals the true artist.
</p>

<p>Now get these modes of expressing time firmly fixed in your mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">The Working Class Must Strike the Blow</p>

<p>You <i>remember</i> Victor Hugo's story of the devil-fish; how the monster <i>put</i>
forth one tentacle after another and <i>coiled</i> it around his victim;
how the hero <i>recalled</i> that there <i>was</i> but one vulnerable spot in
his brute enemy; how at the strategic moment he <i>struck</i> a blow at that spot, and the
terrible demon of the deep <i>shuddered</i>, <i>released</i> his grasp and <i>fell</i> dead.
</p>

<p>Capitalism <i>is</i> a monster which <i>is seizing</i> the body politic. One tentacle
<i>is put</i> forth to grasp the major part of the earnings of the working class;
another <i>has seized</i> the working-woman; another <i>reaches</i> forth to the child;
another <i>has fastened</i> upon government and <i>has made</i> that the instrument of
the powerful classes; still another <i>has turned</i> the pen of the journalist into
a weapon by which the injustice of Capitalism <i>is praised</i> and <i>is defended</i>;
and still another <i>has seized</i> the pulpit, <i>has silenced</i> those who <i>profess</i> to speak
for God and man, or <i>has turned</i> their phrases into open apology and defense
for the crimes of Capitalism!
</p>

<p>But there <i>is</i> one vulnerable spot in Capitalism. If the working class of
the world <i>can see</i> that spot and <i>will strike</i>, they <i>shall be</i> free.
</p>


<p>The fundamental wrong, the basic injustice of the Capitalist System, <i>is</i>
that the resources of land and machinery, to which all the people <i>must have</i>
access, in order to live and labor, <i>are owned</i> by the few and <i>are conducted</i> by
the few for their private profit.
</p>

<p>This <i>is</i> the social tragedy, the monstrous wrong of our time.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>J. Stitt Wilson.</i></span></p>

of the verb is called the <i>present tense</i>; the past time-form, the
<i>past tense</i>; the future time-form, the <i>future tense</i>; the present perfect
time-form, the <i>present perfect tense</i>, etc.

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 7</h2>


<p>The division of words into syllables is quite important as an aid
to pronunciation. It is also a very important matter to understand in
our written speech for it is often necessary to divide a word at the end
of a line. If the word is not properly divided, it is much more difficult
to read and understand. The hyphen is used to divide words into
syllables when carrying a portion to the next line.
</p>

<p>When you must divide a word at the end of a line divide it only
between syllables. Never divide a word of one syllable, no matter how
long it may be. If you cannot get all of it on the line, write it all on
the next line. Do not divide a short word of two syllables if you can
avoid it and never divide such a word when it leaves only one letter on
the line or only one letter to be carried over to the next line, as for
example:
<i>luck-y</i>, <i>a-loud</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>When two or more vowels are used together to make one sound
they should never be separated by the hyphen, as for example, joy-ous,
anx-ious, trail, dis-course, de-feat, boor-ish.
</p>

<p>When two or more vowels placed together are not used to form one
sound then these vowels may be divided, as for example, <i>tri-al</i>,
<i>co-or-di-nate</i>,
<i>he-ro-ic</i>.
</p>

<p>Look up the words in this week's lesson in the dictionary carefully
and divide into syllables. Notice specially the division of words into
syllables where the word contains a diphthong and where it contains
two vowels written together which are not diphthongs. Notice also
the words which have a single vowel as the first or last syllable.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 8</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>You have often read the words <i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i> but did you
ever stop to think of the meaning of these words? We say a body is
organic&mdash;a rock is inorganic; one grows from within, the other is built
from without. A tree is organic; it grows. A house is inorganic; it
is built. The house was never a baby house, growing from a tiny house
to a large one. But the tree was once a baby tree, a sapling, and grew
branch by branch to its present height. So we have two classes of
things&mdash;those which grow and those which are made.
</p>

<p>Language belongs to the class of things which grows. It is organic.
We have even used the same terms in speaking about language that we
use in talking of a tree. We use the words ROOT, STEM and BRANCH
to describe its growth.
</p>

<p>Language, too, has its different terms of life like a tree, its youth,
its maturity, its old age, its death.
</p>

<p>So we have dead languages like Latin and Greek&mdash;languages which
are no longer living,&mdash;no longer serving mankind. But these dead languages
have left living children, languages that have descended from them.
</p>

<p>The Italian language for example is the child, the descendant of
the classical Latin. We have many words in our English language
from these dead languages. About five-sevenths of the words in our
English are from these classical languages. The remaining two-sevenths
are from the Anglo-Saxon. We use the Anglo-Saxon words more frequently,
however, in our every day speech.
</p>

<p>And it is interesting to note that our best poetry&mdash;that which stirs
our blood and touches our hearts&mdash;is written in the strong forceful
Anglo-Saxon words.
</p>

<p>These words we are studying have been through some interesting
experiences as they have passed from race to race down to us and the
history of life is mirrored in their changes. How much more interesting
they seem when we know something of their sources, just as we are more
interested in a man when we know something of his boyhood and youth
and the experiences through which he has passed.
</p>

<p>You may think that the study of verbs is rather difficult and involved,
but it is more simple in English than in any other language.
There are fewer changes in the verb form in order to express time and
person. Do not rely on the memorizing of the rules. Rules never made
one a fluent speaker. Write sentences in which the correct form is used.
Read aloud from the best authors until the sound of the words is familiar
and they come readily to the tongue. We have used for the exercises
in these lessons excerpts from the best authors.
</p>

<p>Study these exercises carefully and note the use of the different
verbs especially, this week. Verbs, like all else, are yours to command.
Command them.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_79" title="pg 79"></a>
PROGRESSIVE VERB PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_132">132.</b> We have learned how to form the three principal time forms,
<i>present</i>, <i>past</i> and <i>future</i> and the perfect or
completed form of each of
the three, <i>present perfect</i>, <i>past perfect</i> and <i>future
perfect</i>. And still we
have such a wonderful language that we can express other shades of
meaning in <i>time</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_133">133.</b> There is still another phase of action which we must have a
verb phrase to express. Suppose you want to describe something you
are now doing and are continuing to do, something not yet completed.
To say, <i>I do it now</i>, is not satisfactory. Instead we say, <i>I am
doing it now</i>.
</p>

<p>You have by the verb phrase, <i>am doing</i>, described a progressive
action, an action <i>going on</i> in the present. You may also want to describe
what you were doing yesterday, an action that continued or <i>progressed</i>
in the past. You would not say, <i>I built the house yesterday</i> but, <i>I was
building the house yesterday</i>. Again you may want to describe an action
which will be <i>progressing</i> or going on in the future. You do not say,
<i>I shall build the house next week</i> but, <i>I shall be building the house next
week</i>.
</p>

<p>So we have progressive verb phrases.</p>

<p><b id="sec_134">134.</b> <b>The present progressive describes an action as continuing
or progressing in the present.</b>
</p>

<p><b>It is formed by using the present time form of the verb</b> <i>be</i>
<b>and the present participle.</b>
</p>

<p>You remember that the present participle is formed by adding <i>ing</i>
to the simple form of the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_135">135.</b> <b>The past progressive time form describes an action which

<tr><td>2d. You will be seeing.</td>     <td>You will be seeing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3d. He will be seeing.</td>      <td>They will be seeing.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_137">137.</b> The perfect time forms also have a progressive form. There
is a difference of meaning in the <i>present perfect</i> and its progressive
form. You say for instance, <i>I have tried all my life to be free</i>. You
mean you have tried until the present time and the inference is that now
you have ceased to try. But, if you say, <i>I have been trying all my life to
be free</i>, we understand that you have tried and are <i>still</i> trying.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_138">138.</b> <b>So we have the present perfect progressive which describes

<h3>ACTIVE AND PASSIVE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_141">141.</b> Notice carefully the following sentences; select the subjects
in these sentences which show <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> performed the action; select
the subjects that show <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> receives the action. Do you notice
any difference in the meaning of these sentences? Do you notice any difference in their form?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The engine struck the man.</li>
<li class="linesp">The man was struck by the engine.</li>

<li>The system enslaves men.</li>
<li class="linesp">Men are enslaved by the system.</li>

<li>Leaders often betray the people.</li>
<li>The people are often betrayed by leaders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us look carefully at the first two sentences. You remember
when we studied transitive verbs we found that every transitive verb
had an <i>object</i> which was the receiver of the action expressed in the verb.
Now you notice in this first sentence, <i>The engine struck the man</i>, we
have the transitive verb <i>struck</i>. <i>Engine</i> is the subject of the verb and
<i>man</i> is the object of the verb, the receiver of the action expressed by
the verb <i>struck</i>.
</p>

<p>Now in the sentence, <i>The man was struck by the engine</i>, we have
the same thought expressed but in a different manner. The word <i>man</i>,
which was the object of the verb <i>struck</i> in the first sentence, has now
become the subject of the sentence, and we have changed our verb form
from <i>struck</i> to <i>was struck</i>. In the first sentence of the subject, <i>engine</i>
was the <i>actor</i>. In the second sentence, <i>The man was struck by the
engine</i>, the subject of the sentence, <i>man</i>, is the <i>receiver</i> of the action
expressed in the verb.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_82" title="pg 82"></a>
<b id="sec_142">142.</b> So we have thus changed the verb form from <i>struck</i> to <i>was
struck</i> to indicate that the subject of the verb is the receiver of the action.
<i>Struck</i> is called the active form of the verb because the subject of the
verb is the actor. <i>Was struck</i> is called the passive form of the verb because
the subject receives the action. Passive means <i>receiving</i>. In the
passive form the subject is the receiver of the action expressed in the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_143">143.</b> You remember that complete verbs have no object or complement,
therefore it would follow that they cannot be put in the passive
form for there is no object to become the receiver of the action. Take
the complete verb, <i>sleep</i>, for example. We do not <i>sleep</i> anything, hence
<i>sleep</i> has no passive form for there is no object which can be used as
the subject, the receiver of the action.
</p>

<p><b>Only transitive verbs can be put into the passive form.</b>
Remember that a transitive verb in the passive form is one that represents
its subject as receiving the action.
</p>

<p>The present, past, future and all the perfect time forms of transitive
verbs can be changed from active to passive. The progressive time forms
can be changed into the passive, but it makes an awkward construction
and should be avoided as much as possible. Occasionally, however,
we find it worth our while to use these forms, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The book is being written by the man.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the passive form of the present progressive, <i>The man is
writing a book</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The book was being written by the man.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the passive form of the past progressive, <i>The man was writing
the book</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_144">144.</b> The future progressive passive is awkward, and the present
and past progressive forms are the only forms we find used in the
passive. The best writers use them sparingly for we can usually say the
same thing by using the active form of the verb and have a sentence
which sounds much better.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>All the verbs in the following sentences are <i>transitive</i> verbs in the
<i>active</i> form. Rewrite each sentence, putting the verb into the <i>passive</i>
form and making the <i>object</i> of the <i>active</i> verb the <i>subject</i> of the <i>passive</i>
verb; as, for example, the first sentence should be rewritten as follows:
</p>

<p><i>War on Russia was declared by Germany on August 1, 1914.</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Germany declared war on Russia, August 1, 1914.</li>
<li>Who will sign the Emancipation Proclamation of the Proletariat?</li>
<li>Marx and Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto.</li>
<li>Spain murdered Francisco Ferrer, October 13, 1909.</li>
<li>We celebrate the first of May as International Labor Day.</li>
<li>The people of Paris stormed the <span class="corr" title="Bastile">Bastille</span>, July 14, 1789.</li>
<li>Wat Tyler was leading the English workers in rebellion against
the King when the Mayor of London stabbed him in 1381.</li>
<li>The Inquisition burned Bruno at the stake for heresy in 1600.</li>
<li>The Paris Commune followed the German siege of Paris in 1871.</li>
</ol>

SUMMARY</h3>

<p><b id="sec_145">145.</b> Now let us take the verb <i>see</i> and name all the time forms
which we can describe with the changes in the verb forms which we
have learned to make and also with the verb phrases which we can construct
with the help of the verbs, <i>be</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>.
</p>

<p>First, we want to express the present, what is happening now, and
we want to put it in both the active and passive forms, so we say:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">PRESENT TIME</th></tr>

<tr><th>Active</th>           <th>Passive</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>         <th class="sub">Singular</th></tr>

<tr><td>I see.</td>            <td>I am seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>You see.</td>          <td>You are seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He sees.</td>          <td>He is seen.</td></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Plural</th>           <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>We see.</td>           <td>We are seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>You see.</td>          <td>You are seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They see.</td>         <td>They are seen.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the only change in the verb form in the present ACTIVE
is the <i>s-form</i> for the third person singular. In the present passive the
only change is the special form of the verb <i>be</i> for the first and
third persons, singular.
</p>

<p>When we want to tell what occurred yesterday or some time in
the past, stated in the active and passive form, we say:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">PAST TIME</th></tr>

<tr><th>Active</th>        <th>Passive</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>         <th class="sub">Singular</th></tr>

<tr><td>I saw.</td>            <td>I was seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>You saw.</td>          <td>You were seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He saw.</td>           <td>He was seen.</td></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Plural</th>           <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>We saw.</td>            <td>We were seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>You saw.</td>           <td>You were seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They saw. </td>         <td>They were seen.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We have one other division of time which we must express&mdash;the
future. Primitive man doubtless lived principally in the present, but
with the development of memory and the means of recording events by
a written language, he was able to make the deeds and achievements
of the past a vital part of his life. But not until the faculty of thinking
developed was the mind able to project itself into the future and make
tomorrow the hope of today. Future time expresses hope, desire, growth.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">FUTURE TIME</th></tr>

<tr><th>Active</th>          <th>Passive</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Singular</th>         <th class="sub">Singular</th></tr>

<tr><td>I shall see.</td>          <td>I shall be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>You will see.</td>         <td>You will be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He will see.</td>          <td>He will be seen.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><a class="pagenum" id="page_84" title="pg 84"></a></td></tr>
<tr><th class="sub">Plural</th>               <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td>You will see.</td>         <td>You will be seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They will see.</td>        <td>They will be seen.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Then you remember we had to devise a way of describing an action
perfected or completed at the present or at some time in the past or
at some time in the future&mdash;so we have present perfect, past perfect
and future perfect.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we study the animal world and try to explain to ourselves that
struggle for existence which is maintained by each living being against
adverse circumstances and against its enemies, we realize that the more the
principles of solidarity and equality are developed in an animal
society, and have become habitual to it, the more chance it has of surviving and
coming triumphantly out of the struggle against hardships and foes. The more
thoroughly each member of the society feels his solidarity with each
other member of the society, the more completely are developed in all of them
those two qualities which are the main factors of all progress; courage, on
the one hand, and, on the other, free individual initiative. And, on the
contrary, the more any animal society, or little group of animals, loses this feeling
of solidarity&mdash;which may chance as the result of exceptional
scarcity or else of exceptional plenty&mdash;the more the two other factors of progress, courage
and individual initiative, diminish; in the end they disappear, and the
society falls into decay and sinks before its foes. Without mutual confidence no
struggle is possible; there is no courage, no initiative, no solidarity&mdash;and no
victory!<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Kropotkin.</i></span></p>

SPELLING
</h2>
<h2>LESSON 8</h2>

<p>In pronouncing words of more than one syllable we always lay a
little greater stress upon one syllable of the word; that is, that syllable
receives the emphasis of the voice so as to make it more prominent
than the other syllables. This is called accent, and the syllable which
receives the special stress is called the accented syllable.
</p>

<p><b>Accent is the stress of the voice upon one syllable of the word.</b></p>

<p>You will notice when you look up the pronunciation of words in
your dictionary that a little mark called the accent mark is placed
after the accented syllable, as for example: di-vide'.
</p>

<p>Many words differ in meaning according to which syllable receives
the accent. Our spelling lesson for this week contains a number of
these words.
</p>

<p>These words, when accented on the first syllable, are nouns; when
accented on the second syllable, they are verbs.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 9</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>You have been studying several weeks now in this Plain English
Course and we trust you are enjoying the unfolding of the powers of
expression. We have been necessarily studying rules to some extent
but you have seen how these grew out of the need for expression. We
have been breaking the sentence up into its different parts. First we
had the names of things and now we are studying the words used to
tell what these things <i>do</i> and <i>are</i>&mdash;namely verbs. And as
our life has grown complex and our powers of thinking diversified covering the whole
range of time, past, present and future, we have had to invent many
forms of the verb to express it all.
</p>

<p>Now do not try to commit these facts concerning the verb to
memory. You are not studying English in order to know rules. You
are studying English that you may be able to say and write the things
you <i>think</i>. So first of all, <i>think</i>, <i>think</i>! That is
your inalienable
right! Do not accept anything just by blind belief. Think it out for
yourself. Study until you see the '<i>why</i>' of it all. "Independent
thinking
has given us the present, and we will forever continue to make tomorrow
better than today. The right to think is inalienable, or a man is a
machine. Thought is life or a human soul is a thing."
</p>

<p>And do not lack the courage of your own thoughts. <i>You</i> do not
need to cringe or apologize to any man. "Our life is not an apology
but a life." Dare to think and dare to express and live your thought.
</p>

<p>Did you ever read Emerson's definition of genius? "To believe
your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private
heart is true for all men,&mdash;that is genius." Then he says, "We dismiss
without notice our own thoughts, because they are ours. Tomorrow a
stranger will say with masterly good sense, precisely what we have
thought and felt all along and we shall be forced to take with shame our
own opinion from another."
</p>

<p>Have you not experienced this? How often we hear some one
express a truth and we say to ourselves, "That is just what I have long
believed but I have never dared say so." We have been so taught all
our lives to depend on some outside power and discredit the power within
ourselves, that we pay no attention to the thoughts that are ours for who
are we that we should dare to think and perchance disagree with those
who have assumed authority over us! But that is precisely what we
should dare to do&mdash;to think and to do our own thinking always. Who
dares place anything before a man!
</p>

<p>So <i>think</i> as you study these lessons and use these rules and formulas
simply as means to an end, as tools to aid you in expressing these
thoughts.
</p>
<p class="center">Yours for Education,</p>
<p class="sig">THE PEOPLE'S COLLEGE.</p>


<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_89" title="pg 89"></a>
PARTICIPLES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_147">147.</b> We have found that the verb has five forms, made by internal
changes in the verb itself,&mdash;the present time form, the s-form, the past
time form, the present participle and the past participle.
</p>

<p>We have also found that we can express various time forms by
verb phrases formed by using the helping verbs, <i>shall</i>,
<i>will</i>, <i>have</i> and <i>be</i>
with one of the verb forms. All of these forms are used as the asserting
word in the sentence. So long as the verb or verb phrase forms the
predicate&mdash;the word or words that assert something of the subject&mdash;it
still remains a verb. But we have found that the participle forms of
the verb may be used as other parts of speech while still retaining some
of the qualities of the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_148">148.</b> You remember a sentence which we used when we studied
participles, <i>Making shoes is his work</i>. Here we have the present
participle
<i>making</i>, with its object <i>shoes</i>, used as the subject of the
verb <i>is</i>.
Now a noun never takes an object, so <i>making</i> in this sentence is
partly a
verb, partly a noun, and is called a participle, which means
<i>partaker</i>.
</p>

<p>We have studied and used two forms of participles, the present and
the past participle. The present participle always ends in <i>ing</i>
and expresses action or existence in the present, or at the time mentioned in
the sentence. For example, <i>being</i>, <i>bringing</i>,
<i>working</i>, <i>seeing</i>, <i>loving</i>, <i>hating</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>The past participle we found to be one of the principal parts of the
verb. It expresses action or existence which is past or completed, at
the time mentioned in the sentence. It is formed by adding <i>d</i> or
<i>ed</i> to the regular verbs and by a change in the form in irregular verbs.
For example, regular verbs: <i>learned</i> from <i>learn</i>,
<i>defeated</i> from <i>defeat</i>,
<i>watched</i> from <i>watch</i>. Irregular verbs: <i>taught</i> from
<i>teach</i>, <i>seen</i> from <i>see</i>, <i>won</i> from <i>win</i>.
</p>

<p><b>We have found that these participles may be used either as
nouns or as adjectives.</b> As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>crying</i> of the child annoyed the people.</li>
<li>The <i>crying</i> child ran to its mother.</li>
<li>The <i>coming</i> of the new day will bring peace.</li>
<li>We await the <i>coming</i> day of peace.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PARTICIPLE PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_149">149.</b> The present and the past participles are each single words;
but we may also have participle phrases; that is, two or more words
used as a participle, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>His <i>having joined</i> the strikers caused him to lose his job.</li>
<li>The man, <i>having been discharged</i>, left the mill.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences we have the participle phrases, <i>having joined</i>
and <i>having been discharged</i>. <i>Having joined</i> is a participle
phrase used as a noun, the subject of the verb <i>caused</i>. <i>Having been
discharged</i> is a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_90" title="pg 90"></a>
participle phrase used as an adjective to modify the noun <i>man</i>.
Notice that <i>having joined</i> is an active participle describing the action
performed by the man who is referred to by the pronoun <i>his</i>. <i>Having been
discharged</i> is a passive participle expressing an action of which the subject
of the sentence, <i>man</i>, is the receiver.
</p>

<p>These are both perfect participles, expressing actions which are
complete at the present time.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_150">150.</b> We have also progressive participles expressing action which
is continuing or progressing. These progressive participles are also
used in both the active and the passive forms. The progressive active
participle is formed by using <i>having been</i> with the present participle, as
<i>having been working</i>. The progressive passive participle is formed by
using <i>being</i> with the past participle, as for example, <i>being watched</i>, <i>being
driven</i>, <i>being gone</i>, etc. So we have six participles, three active and
three passive.

<tr><td><i>Perfect.</i></td>       <td>Having sent.</td>            <td><i>Perfect.</i></td> <td>Having been sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Progressive.</i></td>   <td>Having been sending.</td>    <td><i>Progressive.</i></td> <td>Being sent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>These participle phrases may be used either as nouns or as
adjectives.</b>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences mark the participles and the participle
phrases. Underscore those used as <i>nouns</i> with a single line; those
used as <i>adjectives</i> with two lines.
</p>
<ol>
<li>He denies having been hired by the employer.</li>
<li>Our friends, having arrived, joined us at dinner.</li>
<li>The rain, falling incessantly, kept us from going.</li>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Write the six participle forms of the verbs <i>see</i> and <i>teach</i>,
and use in sentences of your own construction.</p>


<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_91" title="pg 91"></a>
INFINITIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_151">151.</b> We have found that the various forms of the participles
may be used as other parts of speech. They partake of the nature of
a verb and either of a noun or an adjective. Notice the following
sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Traveling is pleasant.</li>
<li>Eating is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you think of any other way in which you could express the
same thought? Do you not sometimes say,</p>

<ul>
<li>To travel is pleasant.</li>
<li>To eat is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have expressed practically the same thought in these two sentences,
which is expressed in the sentences above, where we used the
participle. <i>To travel</i> and <i>to eat</i> are used as nouns,
subjects of the verb <i>is</i>
just as <i>traveling</i> and <i>eating</i> are used as nouns, the
subjects of the verb <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p>Here we have another form of the verb used as a noun. When we
use the verb in this way, we are not speaking of the <i>traveling</i> or
<i>eating</i> as
belonging to or being done by any particular person, nor do we indicate
whether one person or more than one is concerned in the action. It
might be anyone doing the traveling or eating, and it might be one
person or a thousand. We are making a general statement of everybody
in the world, so we call this form the <i>infinitive</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_152">152.</b> Infinite means <i>unlimited</i>, without limit as to persons or
number. Almost every verb in the language may be used in this way,
and since <i>to</i> is generally used before the infinitive, <i>to</i>
is often called the sign of the infinitive. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>To be</i>, or not <i>to be</i>, that is the question.</li>
<li><i>To have</i> and <i>to hold</i> is the problem.</li>
<li>He likes <i>to travel</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You note in all of these infinitives <i>to</i> is used with the simple
form of the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_153">153.</b> <i>To</i> is generally omitted after verbs like <i>help</i>,
<i>hear</i>, <i>bid</i>, <i>feel</i>,
<i>let</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>see</i> and <i>have</i>, or words of similar
meaning. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Help me (to) find it.</li>
<li>He bade me (to) stay.</li>
<li>Feel it (to) shake.</li>
<li>Make him (to) come.</li>
<li>Hear me (to) sing.</li>
<li>Let us (to) go.</li>
<li>See him (to) run.</li>
<li>Have him (to) copy this.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_154">154.</b> <i>To</i> is also omitted after <i>need</i> and <i>dare</i>
when <i>not</i> is used.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>They need to work.</td>      <td>They need not work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They dared to come.</td>     <td>They dared not come.</td></tr>
</table>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_92" title="pg 92"></a>
<b id="sec_155">155.</b> <i>To</i> is sometimes omitted after prepositions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He will do anything for his class, except (to) fight for it.</li>
<li>He would do nothing but (to) go away.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_156">156.</b> We have a number of different forms of the infinitive, both
active and passive. Note the following table:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Active</th>           <th colspan="2">Passive</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>Present.</i></td>        <td>To love.</td>              <td><i>Present.</i></td> <td>To be loved.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Perfect.</i></td>        <td>To have loved.</td>
<td rowspan="3" valign="top"><i>Perfect.</i></td> <td rowspan="3" valign="top">To have been loved.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Present Prog.</i></td>   <td>To be loving.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Perfect Prog.</i></td>   <td>To have been loving.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_157">157.</b> Notice that only the <i>present</i> and <i>perfect</i> infinitives have the
<i>passive</i> form. The progressive infinitives cannot be used in the passive.
Remember also that only <i>incomplete</i> verbs, those which require an object
to receive the action, can have a passive form.
</p>

<p>The verb <i>loved</i>, which we have used in the above table, has a passive
form because it is an incomplete verb, for there must be that which is
the object of our love.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_158">158.</b> The complete verbs,&mdash;verbs which require no object,&mdash;cannot
have a passive form for there is no object to become the receiver of
the action. Take for example the verb <i>dwell</i>. This is a complete verb
which can have no passive form. You cannot dwell anything, therefore
you cannot say <i>to be dwelt</i> or <i>to have been dwelt</i>.
</p>

<p><b>So complete verbs have only the four active forms</b>, as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="4">Active</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>Present.</i></td> <td>To dwell.</td>        <td><i>Present Prog.</i></td> <td>To be dwelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Perfect.</i></td> <td>To have dwelt.</td>   <td><i>Perfect Prog.</i></td> <td>To have been dwelling.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_159">159.</b> Infinitives, like participles, may be used either as nouns or
adjectives. When used as nouns, they are used in the various ways in
which nouns are used. The infinitive may be the <i>subject</i> of a sentence, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>To hesitate</i> now will be fatal.</li>
<li><i>To be defeated</i> is no crime.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_160">160.</b> The infinitive may be the <i>object</i> or <i>complement</i>
of the verb. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He wanted <i>to see</i> you.</li>
<li>His desire is <i>to learn</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_161">161.</b> The infinitive may be used as the object of a
<i>preposition</i>; as,</p>

<ul>
<li>He is about <i>to go</i>.</li>
<li>They will do anything for the cause except <i>to live</i> for it.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_93" title="pg 93"></a>
<b id="sec_162">162.</b> The infinitive may be used as an adjective to modify a noun.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He showed me the way <i>to go</i>.</li>
<li>We must have food <i>to eat</i> and clothes <i>to wear</i>.</li>
<li>The question <i>to be decided</i> is before us.</li>
<li>Claim your right <i>to live</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_163">163.</b> The infinitive may also be used as an adverb to modify the
meaning of a verb, adjective or adverb, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He was forced <i>to go</i>.</li>
<li>They are slow <i>to learn</i>.</li>
<li>The fruit was not ripe enough <i>to eat</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the infinitives in these sentences may all be changed into
adverb phrases. As for example in the first sentence, He was forced
<i>to go</i>, the infinitive <i>to go</i>, which modifies the verb
<i>forced</i>, may be changed to the adverb phrase, <i>into going</i>, thus, <i>He was forced into
going</i>. In the second sentence, <i>They are slow to learn</i>, the infinitive <i>to
learn</i> may be changed into the adverb phrase <i>in learning</i>, thus, <i>They are
slow in learning</i>. In the last sentence, <i>The fruit is not ripe enough to eat</i>, the
infinitive <i>to eat</i>, which modifies the adverb <i>enough</i>, may be changed
into the adverb phrase, <i>for eating</i>, as for example, <i>The fruit was not ripe
enough for eating</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_164">164.</b> The infinitive is quite a useful form of the verb, and we will
find that we use it very frequently in expressing our ideas. While it
is not the asserting word in the sentence, it retains the nature of a verb
and may have both an object and an adverb modifier. As for example,
in the sentence:
</p>

<ul><li>I wish <i>to learn</i> my lesson quickly.</li></ul>

<p><i>To learn</i> is the infinitive, used as a noun, the object of the verb <i>wish</i>.
The infinitive also has an object, to learn&mdash;<i>what?</i> <i>My lesson</i> is the object
of the infinitive <i>to learn</i>. We also have an adverb modifier in the adverb
<i>quickly</i>, which tells <i>how</i> I wish to learn my lesson. So the infinitive
retains its verb nature, in that it may have an object and it may be modified by an adverb.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Notice carefully the use of the infinitives in the following sentences.
Underscore all infinitives.
</p>

<ol>
<li>To remain ignorant is to remain a slave.</li>
<li>Teach us to think and give us courage to act.</li>
<li>Children love to be praised, but hate to be censured.</li>
<li>To obey is the creed taught the working class by the masters.</li>
<li>To be exploited has always been the fate of the workers.</li>
<li>Ferrer wrote on his prison wall, "To love a woman passionately,
to have an ideal which I can serve, to have the desire to fight until I
win&mdash;what more can I wish or ask?"</li>
<li>The people wish the man to be punished for the crime.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_94" title="pg 94"></a></li>
<li>Primitive man found plenty of wood to burn.</li>
<li>We have learned to use coal and oil.</li>
<li>The lecture to have been given this evening has been postponed.</li>
<li>They are eager to hear the news.</li>
<li>He has failed to come.</li>
<li>We felt the house shake on its foundation.</li>
<li>Have him find the book for me.</li>
<li>To be defeated is no crime; never to have dared is the real crime.</li>
<li>The rich will do anything for the poor except to get off their backs.</li>
<li>To have slept while others fought is your shame.</li>
<li>Claim your right to do, to dream and to dare.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Write sentences containing the six infinitive forms of the verb
<i>obey.</i></p>


<h3>DON'TS FOR INFINITIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_165">165.</b> <b>Don't split your infinitives.</b> Keep the <i>to</i> and
the infinitive
together as much as possible. Don't say, <i>They intended to never come
back</i>. Say rather, <i>They intended never to come back</i>.
Sometimes, however,
the meaning can be more aptly expressed by placing the adverb
modifier between the <i>to</i> and the infinitive, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To almost succeed is not enough.</li>
<li>It will be found to far exceed our expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the adverbs <i>almost</i> and <i>far</i> express our meaning
more closely if they are placed between the <i>to</i> and the infinitive. Ordinarily,
however, do not split your infinitives, but place the adverb modifier
either before or after the infinitive.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_166">166.</b> <b>Don't use</b> <i>to</i> <b>by itself without the rest of the infinitive.</b>
Don't say, <i>Do as I tell you to</i>. Say instead, <i>Do as I tell you to do</i>; or,
<i>Do as I tell you.</i> Don't say, <i>He deceived us once and he is likely to
again</i>. Say rather, <i>He deceived us once and he is likely to deceive us
again</i>, or <i>to do so again</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_167">167.</b> <b>Don't use</b> <i>and</i> <b>for</b> <i>to</i>.  Don't
say, <i>Try and go if you can</i>. Say instead, <i>Try to go if you can</i>.
</p>

<p>Correct the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>We ought to bravely fight for our rights.</li>
<li>I will do all my employer tells me to.</li>
<li>We shall try and get our lessons.</li>
<li>I ought to at least help my comrades but I am afraid to.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Study carefully the infinitives in the following quotation. Notice
which are active and which are passive infinitives.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The twenty thousand men prematurely slain on a field of battle, mean,
to the women of their race, twenty thousand human creatures <i>to be
borne</i>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_95" title="pg 95"></a>
within them for months, <i>to be given</i> birth to in anguish, <i>to be fed</i> from their
breasts and <i>to be reared</i> with toil, if the members of the tribe and the
strength of the nation are <i>to be maintained</i>. In nations continually at war,
incessant and unbroken child-bearing is by war imposed on all women if the
state is <i>to survive</i>; and whenever war occurs, if numbers are <i>to be maintained</i>,
there must be an increased child-bearing and rearing. This throws upon
woman, as woman, a war tax, compared with which all that the male expends
in military preparations is comparatively light.</p>

<p>It is especially in the domain of war that we, the bearers of men's bodies,
who supply its most valuable munition, who, not amid the clamor and ardor
of battle, but singly, and alone, with a three-in-the-morning courage, shed our
blood and face death that the battle-field might have its food, a food more
precious to us than our heart's blood; it is we, especially, who, in the domain
of war, have our word <i>to say</i>, a word no man can say for us. It is our intention
<i>to enter</i> into the domain of war and <i>to labor</i> there till in the course of
generations we have extinguished it.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Olive Schreiner.</i></span></p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 9</h2>


<p>In our English lessons, we have been studying the division of words
into parts of speech. We have been studying them as we use them in
expressing our thoughts but we may study them in other ways also.
We may study them as words alone.
</p>

<p>Studied in this way we find that we have simple, compound and
derivative words. For example, <i>man</i>, <i>man-slaughter</i>,
<i>manly</i>. <i>Man</i> is
a simple word. <i>Man-slaughter</i> is a compound word formed of twosimple
words. <i>Manly</i> is a derivative word derived from <i>man</i>.
</p>

<p>When a compound word is first formed, it is usually written with a
hyphen; but after the word has been used awhile the hyphen is often
dropped and the two parts are written together as a simple word.
</p>

<p><b>A simple word is a single word which cannot be divided into
other words without changing its meaning.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A compound word is composed of two or more simple words
into which it may be divided, each retaining its own meaning.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A derivative word is one which is derived from a simple word
by the addition of another syllable.</b></p>

<p>In next week's lesson we will take up the study of these derivatives.</p>

<p>Divide the compound words in this week's lesson into the simple
words of which they are composed.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 10</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We have been studying this course in Plain English for some weeks
now and I trust that you have been enjoying as well as benefiting by
the study of our wonderful and expressive language. Did you ever stop
to think what a wonderful step it was in evolution when man first began
to use the spoken word? And yet it was a still more wonderful step
in advance when he began to use the written word for our highest
evolution, and development would have been impossible without the help
of written speech. An illiterate man may be a good workman and prosperous
so far as the material things of life and his immediate contact
with his fellow men are concerned, but we have only to think for a
moment of what this world would be if we had no written language, to
understand what a mighty power it has been in evolution.
</p>

<p>Suppose we had no way by which we could communicate with our
friends at a distance. Suppose there were no written words by which
we could set down the countless dealings between man and man. What
a hopeless tangle this social life of ours would soon become! Suppose
also that we had no knowledge of the past, no knowledge of the discoveries
and inventions of past generations except that which could be
handed down to us through oral speech. All our knowledge of history,
of the deeds and development of the past, all the observations by which
science has uncovered to us the mysteries of nature would be largely
lost to us. It was the invention of writing alone which made possible
man's growth from barbarism to civilization, and it is more true than
we oftentimes realize, that it is "only a wall of books that separates
the civilized man of to-day from the savage of yesterday." And yet
I wonder if we have ever stopped to think how this art of writing developed.
Knowledge of the alphabet and of the letters by which we
form our words and hence are able to express our ideas, has become such
a common-place thing to us that we have forgotten what a wonder it
is and how it has slowly grown and developed through the centuries.
Yet there are races to-day that have no written language such as we
know and to whom our written language seems truly a miracle.
</p>

<p>The story is told of an Indian who was sent from one colony to
another with four loaves of bread accompanied by a letter stating their
number. The Indian ate one of the loaves and of course, was found
out. The next time when he was sent upon a similar errand he repeated
the theft but he took the precaution to hide the letter under a stone
while he was eating the bread so that it might not see him!
</p>

<p>But it is only the things that we do not understand which we invest
with mystery and as we study the story of the alphabet in this
series of letters we find that it has been a natural development accomplished
by the growing powers of man. In succeeding letters we will
trace this most interesting story of the alphabet.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_98" title="pg 98"></a>
HELPING VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_168">168.</b> We have found that whenever a verb is used by itself in
making an assertion it denotes either present or past time. When we
use a verb phrase, it expresses some other time than the past or present.
These verb phrases are formed by using <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>,
<i>have</i>, <i>had</i>, and the
various forms of the verb <i>be</i> with some form of the principal verb.
These verbs which help to form verb phrases are called <i>helping</i>,
or <i>auxiliary verbs</i>. Auxiliary means helping.
</p>

<p>We have used <i>have</i> and <i>had</i> with the past participle to form the
present perfect and past perfect time forms. We have used <i>shall</i> and
<i>will</i> with different forms of the verb to denote future time, and we have
used different forms of the verb <i>be</i> in making the various other time
forms. So <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>had</i> and the
various forms of the verb <i>be</i>
are <i>helping verbs</i>, which we use to help us in making verb phrases.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_169">169.</b> But these are not all of the helping verbs. There are other
helping verbs which we use in forming verb phrases to express different
ideas. These are such verbs as <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>,
<i>may</i> and <i>might</i>, <i>can</i>
and <i>could</i>, <i>must</i> and <i>ought</i>, <i>do</i> and <i>did</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Fill the blank spaces in the following sentences with the appropriate
forms of the helping verbs, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>have</i>,
<i>had</i> and <i>be</i>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>When......the workers organize?</li>
<li>Education......help us win.</li>
<li>The world......had enough of war.</li>
<li>We......deceived by the masters.</li>
<li>The workers......organized into craft unions.</li>
<li>They......never ceased the struggle.</li>
<li>The state......founded on exploitation.</li>
<li>Mutual aid......been an important factor in evolution.</li>
<li>The truth......taught to the people.</li>
<li>The victory......gained by the proletariat.</li>
<li>The nations of Europe......preparing for war for years.</li>
<li>The International......recognized war for defense.</li>
<li>We......not made the class distinctions, but we......recognize
them as long as they exist.</li>
<li>The evolution of animals and the evolution of plants......proceeded
according to the same general laws.</li>
<li>We......never win while the majority remains ignorant.</li>
<li>The strikers......betrayed by their leaders.</li>
</ol>


<h3>SHOULD AND WOULD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_170">170.</b> <i>Should</i> and <i>would</i> are the past-time forms of
<i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>.
We use them to express action or existence dependent upon some
condition, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I should go if I were well enough.</li>
<li>He should join us if you asked him.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_99" title="pg 99"></a>
In these sentences <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> express action which
is possible now or will be in the future, provided some other action takes place.
</p>

<p>The same distinction which we found made in the use <i>shall</i> and
<i>will</i> has been made with <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>; that is,
that <i>should</i> used with
the first person, expresses action dependent upon condition; but <i>would</i>,
used with the first person, implies exercise of the will. This rule is
not closely followed, though it expresses a nice distinction in the use of
<i>should</i> and <i>would</i>. In ordinary usage we use either
<i>should</i> or <i>would</i>
with the first person without any distinction of meaning, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I should struggle on even if it meant death.</li>
<li>I would stand for my principles though I stood entirely alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use <i>should</i> however, with the second and third persons
to express an action or existence dependent upon some condition.
<i>Should</i> used with the second and third person implies obligation. <i>Would</i>
is used with the second or third person to express an action dependent
upon some condition, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He would not go, even if you insisted.</li>
<li>They would come if you invited them.</li>
<li>You would believe him if you could hear him.</li>
<li>You would be surprised if I should tell you the reason.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_171">171.</b> <i>Should</i> and <i>would</i> in all of the sentences which
we have quoted are used to express action or existence dependent upon some condition
which is expressed in that part of the sentence introduced by such conjunctions
as <i>if</i> and <i>though</i>.
</p>

<p>The parts of the sentence introduced by these conjunctions express
the condition upon which the other action is dependent. When we use
<i>should</i> in sentences without this condition, it means practically the same
as <i>ought</i>, and implies an obligation. We use <i>should</i> with the first and
second and third persons when we use it with this meaning, as for example:
</p>

<p>
I should have gone yesterday.
You should be with us in this fight.
They should never fear defeat.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_172">172.</b> <i>Ought</i> could be used in all these sentences and
express practically the same meaning. <i>Should</i> used in this way implies obligation.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following sentences. Write in the blank space
preceding each sentence the number of the paragraph in the lesson
which governs the use of the helping verb in that sentence.
</p>

<ol>
<li> ...... The workers should organize if they desire to control
production.</li>
<li> ...... The proletariat would destroy this system if they understood
their power.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_100" title="pg 100"></a>
 ...... Every worker would join his fellows if he could but realize
the class struggle.</li>
<li> ...... We would all enjoy plenty if we produced for use instead of
for profit.</li>
<li> ...... The ruling class would not give up their privileges even
though they knew that their cupidity endangers society.</li>
<li> ...... The injury of one should be the injury of all.</li>
<li> ...... The workers' International should stand for the international
solidarity of the workers.</li>
<li> ...... You should never fear the ridicule of little minds.</li>
<li> ...... You would never fear ridicule if you were conscious of your
own power.</li>
<li> ...... No man should fear to think for himself.</li>
<li> ...... No man would fear to think for himself if the world were
truly free.</li>
<li> ...... Compromise now would mean defeat.</li>
</ol>


<h3>MAY AND MIGHT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_173">173.</b> <i>May</i> used as a helping verb means present permission
in regard to an action or possession, as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You may come with us.</li>
<li>He may have the money.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_174">174.</b> It may also mean a possible action or possession. <i>You
may come with us</i>, for example, might mean that some time in the future
it is possible that you will come with us. <i>He may have the money</i>, might
mean either <i>He is given permission to have the money</i>, or <i>It is possible
that he has it</i>.
</p>

<p><i>May</i>, used with many verb forms, means <i>it is possible</i>. For example:
<i>He may be hungry</i>, <i>He may have starved</i>. <i>He may have been starving</i>;
that is, it is possible that <i>he is hungry</i>; that <i>he has starved</i>; that <i>he was
starving</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_175">175.</b> <i>Might</i> is the past form of <i>may</i> and expresses past permission
to do or to be and also possibility in the past. For example: <i>The
officer said he might go</i>. That is, he gave him permission to go. <i>You
might have helped your comrades</i>; that is, <i>you had the power to have
helped</i>.
</p>

<p><i>Might</i> is also used to express permission or the power to do in the
present and future, on condition. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He might find work if he were trained.</li>
<li>The workers might destroy this insane system if they would.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following sentences. Write in the blank space
preceding each sentence the number of the paragraph in the lesson which
governs the use of the helping verbs <i>may</i> or <i>might</i> in that
sentence.
</p>

<ol>
<li> ...... The solidarity of the workers might have averted this war.</li>

<li>
<div class="poem">
<p> ......"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,</p>
<p class="i4">The saddest are these&mdash;'it might have been.'"</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_101" title="pg 101"></a>
 ...... You might join us.</li>

<li> ...... The people struggle that they may live.</li>
<li> ...... Try; you might succeed.</li>
<li>...... The day may come when this day's deeds shall be remembered.</li>
<li> ...... Victory might be ours if we dared to face the issue.</li>

<li>
<div class="poem">
<p>......"Men may come and men may go;</p>
<p class="i4">But I go on forever."</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>...... It seemed possible that we might win.</li>
<li>...... May we ever be loyal and true!</li>
<li>...... It appeared for a time that we might be involved in war.</li>
<li>...... Let come what may, we will not yield.</li>
</ol>


<h3>CAN AND COULD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_176">176.</b> <i>Can</i> is the present-time form and <i>could</i> the
past-time form, and both imply ability or power to do or to be.
</p>

<p><i>You can go</i> means <i>You are able to go</i>,&mdash;<i>You have the
power to go</i>.
<i>You may go</i> means <i>You have permission to go</i>. <i>Can</i> is
often used when
we should use <i>may</i>, when we mean to give permission. Habit plays a
great part in our life and knowledge of the right way does not always
suffice. It is only continued effort that will establish correct habits
of speech. Good English would be easy of accomplishment if "to do
were as easy as to know what it were good to do."
</p>

<p>We are too often like the mother in the story. "Can I have a
piece of pie?" asked the child. "May I?" the mother corrected. Then
the child asked, "May I have a piece of pie?" and the mother answered,
"Yes, you can." Knowledge said, <i>may</i>; habit said <i>can</i>, and
the ready tongue obeyed the force of habit.
</p>

<p>Say the correct word over and over aloud until it sounds right to
your ear and flows readily to your tongue.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_177">177.</b> <i>Could</i> is sometimes used in the present sense to
denote power to do, conditioned upon willingness, as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He could if he would.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following sentences. Write in the blank space
preceding each sentence the number of the paragraph in the lesson
which governs the use of the helping verbs <i>can</i> or <i>could</i> in
that sentence.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<div class="poem">
<p>...... I can say love when others say hate;</p>
<p class="i4">I can say every man when others say one man;</p>
<p class="i4">What can I do? I can give myself to life,</p>
<p class="i4">When other men refuse themselves to life.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>...... No one can be free till all are free.</li>
<li>...... They could win their freedom if they would prepare themselves
to be free.</li>
<li>...... What can I do, being alone?</li>
<li>...... If all men could catch the vision of freedom, wars would cease.</li>
<li>...... Could you find a better way to spend your time than in study?</li>
<li>...... Men would rise in revolt if they could know the facts.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_102" title="pg 102"></a>
MUST AND OUGHT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_178">178.</b> <i>Must</i> and <i>ought</i> imply obligation. <i>Must</i>
conveys the idea of being obliged to do an action from necessity or compulsion, as,
</p>

<ul>
<li>You must have known it.</li>
<li>He must go.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ought</i> was originally the past time form of <i>owe</i>, hence means <i>to be
indebted to</i>, <i>to owe</i>. It conveys the idea of a moral obligation, as,
</p>

<ul>
<li>You ought to help the cause.</li>
<li>You ought to understand.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_179">179</b>. <i>Ought</i> is always used with the infinitive, and the same form
is used to express both the present and the past time. The difference
in time is expressed by a change in the infinitive instead of a change
in the form of the helping verb. With <i>may</i> and <i>might</i> and
<i>can</i> and <i>could</i>,
present and past time are expressed by a change in the form of the helping
verb. With the helping verb <i>ought</i>, the difference in time is expressed
in the infinitive. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He ought to pay us our wages.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means, <i>He owes it to us to pay us our wages now</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>He ought to have paid us our wages.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means, <i>He owed it to us to pay us our wages some time in the
past</i>.</p>

<p><b id="sec_180">180.</b> The present infinitive is used with the helping verb <i>ought</i>
to express present time and the perfect infinitive is used with <i>ought</i> to
express past time.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Study carefully the following sentences. Write in the blank space
preceding each sentence the number of the paragraph in the lesson which
governs the use of the helping verb <i>must</i> or <i>ought</i> in that
sentence.
</p>

<ol>
<li>...... Service must be the key note of the future.</li>
<li>...... Competition must give place to co-operation.</li>
<li>...... Ought we to fear, who know the truth?</li>
<li>...... Government ought to be the administration of things.</li>
<li>...... No man ought to have the power of life and death over
any other human being.</li>
<li>...... It may cost much but humanity must be set free at any cost.</li>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_103" title="pg 103"></a>
DO AND DID</h3>

<p><b id="sec_181">181.</b> <i>Do</i> and <i>did</i> are used as helping verbs to give
emphasis&mdash;to form emphatic verb phrases. <i>Do</i> is the present time form and
<i>did</i> the past time form, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I do wish you would come.</li>
<li>I did hope he would win.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_182">182.</b> When we use the negative <i>not</i> we use the helping verbs
<i>do</i> and <i>did</i> to form our verb phrases. For example, we do not say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I obey not.</li>
<li>I walked not.</li>
<li>He comes not.</li>
<li>They arrived not.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in expressing the present and past time forms with the negative
<i>not</i>, we say instead:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not obey.</li>
<li>I did not walk.</li>
<li>He does not come.</li>
<li>They did not arrive.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_183">183.</b> We also use <i>do</i> and <i>did</i> with the present and
past time forms
of the verb in writing interrogative sentences. For example, we do not say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Comes he with them?</li>
<li>Studied you yesterday?</li>
<li>Found they the book?</li>
<li>Think you it is true?</li>
</ul>

<p>But we say instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does he come with them?</li>
<li>Did you study yesterday?</li>
<li>Did they find the book?</li>
<li>Do you think it is true?</li>

<h4>Exercise 8</h4>

<p>Note the use of the helping verbs in the following quotation. Could
you use <i>might</i> or <i>must</i> or <i>ought</i> anywhere and
strengthen the emphasis?
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is right and necessary that all men should have work to do which shall
be worth doing and be of itself pleasant to do; and which should be done
under such conditions as would make it neither over-wearisome nor

<p>Turn that claim about as I may, think of it as long as I can, I cannot find
that it is an exorbitant claim; yet if society would or could admit it, the face

be ended. To feel that we were doing work useful to others and pleasant to
ourselves, and that such work and its due reward could not fail us! What

the world happy, must be revolution."<span class="author">&mdash;<i>William Morris.</i></span>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 10</h2>


<p>Simple words are sometimes spoken of as root words. <i>Root</i> means
that from which something grows. We know our language is a living,
growing thing and these root words are the roots where the growth begins.
One way in which this growth is accomplished and new words
added to our language is by placing syllables before or after the root
word&mdash;the simple word&mdash;as, for example: <i>unmanly</i>.
</p>

<p>In this we have a syllable placed before and a syllable placed after
the root word <i>man</i>. The syllable placed before the root word is called
the prefix from the Latin <i>pre</i> meaning <i>before</i> and the Latin word to
place. Therefore, prefix means literally <i>to place before</i>.
</p>

<p><b>A prefix consists of one or more syllables placed before a word
to qualify its meaning.</b>
</p>

<p>The syllable placed after the root word, or simple word, is called
the suffix, from the Latin <i>sub</i> meaning after and the Latin word to place.
<i>Subfix</i> the word should be literally, but for the sake of the
sound&mdash;the euphony, the good sound&mdash;we say <i>suffix</i>.
</p>

<p><b>A suffix consists of one or more syllables placed after a word to
qualify its meaning.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The words made by adding prefixes and suffixes are called derivative
words.</b>
</p>

<p>You remember we used a suffix in forming participles. The present
participle is formed by adding the suffix <i>ing</i> to the simple form of the
verb. The past participle is formed by adding the suffix <i>ed</i> to the simple
form of the verb.
</p>

<p>The words in the spelling lesson for this week are derivative words
formed by adding a prefix or suffix, or both, to the simple word. Draw
a line through the prefix and the suffix and leave the simple or root
word.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 11</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>As we begin the study of the story of the alphabet and the evolution
of written speech, we discover that primitive man imagined the art of
writing to have had divine origin, to have been handed down from the
powers above.</p>

<p>It is natural for us to personify and envelop in mystery the things
that we do not understand. So these primitive people have attributed
the discovery of the art of writing to the gods and have looked upon
the parchment containing the written word which they cannot understand,
as possessing magical power; but as we come to learn the origin
and causes of things, they are divested of their mystery and become no
longer gods and enslavers of men. We understand the laws that govern
their action and they become our servants. Take lightning for example.
Primitive people personified the lightning or called it the thunder bolts
of Jove or attributed it to an act of divine providence. We have learned
the laws that govern the action of electricity and so this mighty giant
is no longer a god to whom we bow in submission, and who slays us at
his whim. He has become our most faithful servant who travels along
the wires at our behest and obeys our every bidding. So in the early
stages, the art of writing belonged only to the favored few and was made
the means of enslavement of the common people instead of the means
of liberation.</p>

<p>Knowledge has always been power and the ruling classes of the
world, desiring power over the people, have striven to keep knowledge
within their own circle; so the art of writing was known only to the few.
The few books in circulation were laboriously written by hand and circulated,
largely among the clergy, who used it as priests have ever
used their power&mdash;from medicine man to Pope,&mdash;for the enslavement
of the people and the protection of the privileges of a few. This is aptly
illustrated in the law which was known as "the benefit of clergy" which
was not entirely repealed until the year 1827. Under this statute, exemption
from trial for criminal offenses was given to the clergy and also to
any man who could read. If a person were sentenced to death for some
criminal offense, the bishop of that community might claim him as a
clerk and if, when given a Latin book, he could read a verse or two,
the court would declare "he reads like a clerk" and the offender was
only burned in the hand and then set free.</p>

<p>The invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century which
made possible the diffusion of knowledge among the people, was the
beginning of the emancipation of the workers of the world. But while
we realize, perhaps, what this art of writing means to us and by the
knowledge of its growth and development no longer ascribe it to divine
origin or consider it a blessing designed by a supreme being for a favored
few, still most of us know very little of the interesting evolution which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_107" title="pg 107"></a>
made possible the alphabet which is the basis of our written and spoken
language of to-day. When we realize how through all these long centuries
man has been struggling, striving, evolving, developing, reaching
out toward fuller, freer and richer life, it gives us courage in our struggle
and makes us see ourselves, not as individuals alone, but as links in a
mighty chain clasping hands with that primitive man of the past, from
whom we have inherited the power we now possess, and reaching forth
also to clasp the hands of those who shall come and handing on to them
the things for which we have struggled and added to the inheritance
of the past.</p>

<p>Next week we will have the story of man's first beginning in the
art of writing.</p>

<h3>THE VERB "BE"</h3>

<p><b id="sec_185">185.</b> The verb is perhaps the most difficult part of speech to master
because it has more form changes than any other part of speech.
</p>

<p>In this lesson we are going to emphasize the most important things
to remember in the study of the verb and also call attention to the most
common mistakes.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_186">186.</b> First, master that little verb be in all its forms. The only
way to do this is to commit to memory these forms. Say them over
and over until any other form does not sound right.

<h3>A FREQUENT MISTAKE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_188">188.</b> Perhaps one of the most frequent mistakes is the confusion
in the use of the past time form and the past participle. Remember
that the past time form is never used except in expressing past time;
<a class="pagenum" id="page_108" title="pg 108"></a>
never use it in forming a verb phrase. Take the verb <i>do</i>, for example&mdash;say,
<i>He did the work</i>, never, <i>He done the work</i>; but we should say, <i>He
has done the work</i>, never, <i>He has did the work</i>. <i>Say</i> and
<i>seen</i> are confused in the same manner. Watch this carefully.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Underline the correct word in the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Who did&mdash;done it?</li>

<li>He sung&mdash;sang well.</li>

<li>He sunk&mdash;sank before we could reach him.</li>

<li>She written&mdash;wrote him a letter.</li>

<li>He taken&mdash;took the book.</li>

<li>They swum&mdash;swam the river.</li>

<li>I saw&mdash;seen him do it.</li>

<li>They drank&mdash;drunk too much.</li>

<li>He soon began&mdash;begun to fail.</li>

<li>The lad ran&mdash;run home.</li>

<li>They come&mdash;came yesterday.</li>
</ol>


<h3>WITH HELPING VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_189">189.</b> Never use the past time form with the helping verbs <i>has</i>,
<i>had</i>, <i>was</i> and <i>were</i>. Always use the past participle.
Watch this carefully. For example, never say, <i>He has went</i>. <i>Went</i> is the past time
form. Say, <i>He has gone</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Underscore the correct word in the following sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>He had tore&mdash;torn the book.</li>

<li>Have you ever sang&mdash;sung this tune?</li>

<li>They have showed&mdash;shown us how to win.</li>

<li>She has went&mdash;gone away.</li>

<li>The trees were shook&mdash;shaken by the wind.</li>

<li>He was chose&mdash;chosen for leader.</li>

<li>He has rose&mdash;risen from the ranks.</li>

<li>It was wrote&mdash;written by him.</li>

<li>He has took&mdash;taken the prize.</li>

<li>He was gave&mdash;given the money.</li>

<li>I have forgot&mdash;forgotten the rule.</li>

<li>The river was froze&mdash;frozen over.</li>

<li>The machine was broke&mdash;broken.</li>

<li>It was wore&mdash;worn out.</li>

<li>The meal was ate&mdash;eaten in silence.</li>
</ol>


<h3>PAST TIME FORMS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_190">190.</b> Watch your speech to see if you use an incorrect verb form
for the past time form. Study the table of irregular verbs and refer
<a class="pagenum" id="page_109" title="pg 109"></a>
to it frequently. We often make the mistake of forming the past time
form by adding <i>ed</i> when properly it is formed irregularly. For
example:
we often say <i>drawed</i> for <i>drew</i>, <i>throwed</i> for
<i>threw</i>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Draw a line under the correct form in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>He grew&mdash;growed rapidly.</li>
<li>He knew&mdash;knowed better.</li>
<li>He catched&mdash;caught the ball.</li>
<li>He drew&mdash;drawed the water.</li>
<li>They threw&mdash;throwed him over.</li>
<li>I drinked&mdash;drank the water.</li>
<li>I climbed&mdash;clumb the tree.</li>
<li>I seed&mdash;saw him do it.</li>
<li>She teached&mdash;taught school.</li>
</ol>


<h3>VERBS OF SIMILAR FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_191">191.</b> Do not use one verb for another of similar form but different
meaning. The following are the most common of these:
</p>

<p><b>Lay</b> (incomplete verb, requires an object) meaning to place or to
put; as, <i>to lay the book down</i>. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>,
lay; <i>Past</i>, laid; <i>Past participle</i>, laid.
</p>

<p><b>Lie</b> (complete verb, takes no object) meaning
to recline, to rest; as, <i>to lie in bed</i>. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>, lie;
<i>Past</i>, lay; <i>Past participle</i>, lain.
</p>

<p><b>Set</b> (incomplete verb, requires an object) meaning to place or to
put; as, <i>to set the table</i>. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>, set;
<i>Past</i>, set; <i>Past participle</i>, set.
</p>

<p><b>Sit</b> (complete verb, takes no object) meaning to rest, as, <i>to sit in a
chair</i>. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>, sit; <i>Past</i>, sat; <i>Past participle</i>, sat.
</p>

<p><b>Raise</b> (incomplete verb, requires an object) meaning to cause to
rise, to lift up. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>, raise; <i>Past</i>,
raised; <i>Past participle</i>, raised.
</p>

<p><b>Rise</b> (complete verb, takes no object) meaning to get up, to
ascend. Principal parts: <i>Present</i>, rise; <i>Past</i>, rose; <i>Past
participle</i>, risen.

<h3>COMMON ERRORS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_194">194.</b> Remember that in the present time form the third person
singular takes the s-form, but the s-form is never used <i>except</i>
with the <i>third person singular</i>. We often make the mistake of using the
<i>s-form</i> with a <i>plural</i> subject. Notice carefully the following sentences,
and correct the errors. All of the sentences are wrong.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The days is getting shorter.</li>
<li>The men has struck.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_111" title="pg 111"></a>
The trains was late.</li>
<li>These papers is written for you.</li>
<li>You was disappointed, wasn't you?</li>
<li>There is several coming.</li>
<li>The nights was dark and cloudy.</li>
<li>The clouds has gathered.</li>
<li>They was anxious to come.</li>
</ol>

<p><b id="sec_195">195.</b> <b>When two subjects are connected by</b> <i>and</i>, <b>the s-form of
the verb must not be used</b>, unless both subjects refer to one person; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The president and the secretary (two persons) were late.</li>
<li>The president and secretary (one person) was elected.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_196">196.</b> <b>But when the two subjects are connected by</b> <i>or</i>
<b>or</b> <i>nor</i> <b>then
use the s-form of the verb</b>; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Neither Germany nor Russia admits a war of offense.</li>
<li>Either the House or the Senate rejects the bill.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_197">197.</b> <b>Never use the infinitive sign</b> <i>to</i> <b>by
itself</b>; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I have not written and do not expect <i>to</i>.</li>
<li>He has not gone nor does he intend <i>to</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_198">198.</b> <b>Never use don't for doesn't.</b> The use of <i>don't</i> for <i>doesn't</i>
is a very common mistake. <i>Don't</i> is a contraction of <i>do not</i> and <i>doesn't</i>
of <i>does not</i>. When you are in doubt as to which to use, think or speak
the two words in full and see if the verb agrees with the subject. <i>Do
not</i> is used with a plural subject, and <i>does not</i> with a singular subject.
For example: <i>He don't believe me</i>. This sentence in full would be, <i>He
do not believe me</i>, which is incorrect. <i>He does not</i> (<i>doesn't</i>) <i>believe me</i>
is correct. Or, <i>They doesn't believe me</i>. This sentence in full would
read, <i>They does not believe me</i>, which is incorrect. <i>They do not</i> (<i>don't</i>)
<i>believe me</i> is correct.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_199">199.</b> <b>Do not use</b> <i>has got</i>, <b>or</b> <i>have got</i>
<b>for</b> <i>must</i>. For example, do
not say, <i>We have got to go</i>. Say, <i>We must go</i>. Not, <i>He
has got to do what I say</i>; but, <i>He must do as I say</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_200">200.</b> <b>Do not say</b> <i>had ought</i>. For example: <i>You had ought to
know better</i>. Omit the <i>had</i>; it is unnecessary and incorrect. Say, <i>You
ought to know better</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_201">201.</b> <b>Do not say</b> <i>says I</i> <b>or</b> <i>thinks I</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Says I, "Will you go?"</li>
<li>Says he, "That's what will happen."</li>
<li>Thinks I to myself, "I'll show you."</li>
</ul>

<p>These are incorrect. Say instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>I said, "Will you go?"</li>
<li>He said, "That's what will happen."</li>
<li>I thought, "I'll show you."</li>

Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Mark all the verbs in the following quotations and note carefully
their use.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1. Speak properly and in as few words as you can but always plainly; for the end of speech

<p class="i2">Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,</p>
<p class="i2">Though baffled oft, is ever won."</p>
</li>

<p>Note the use of <i>may</i> and <i>can</i> in this quotation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>3. Knowledge cannot be stolen from us. It cannot be bought or
sold. We may be poor, and the sheriff may come and sell our furniture,

</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the use of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> and <i>would</i> and
<i>should</i> in the following.
Richard Grant White says: "I do not know in English literature another
passage in which the distinction between <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>
and <i>would</i> and <i>should</i> is at once so elegantly, so variously, so precisely, and
so compactly illustrated."
</p>

<ul>
<li class="poem">

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Note the nouns as well as the verbs in the following quotation.
Note also the use of infinitives and participles. Mark every verb and
use it in a sentence of your own.
</p>

<h4>Faith and Truth</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say "Believe;" I say "Trust."</p>

<p>Between those two words is a great gulf fixed.</p>

<p>The idea that there can be a moral obligation to believe external facts
is unworthy of a freeman, but to trust is as much the true nature
of man as it is that of a babe to draw in its mother's milk.
</p>

<p>You say "Creed;" I say "Faith."</p>

<p>A creed at best is but a sorry caricature of a faith.</p>

<p>Faith is the proper atmosphere of man, trust is his native buoyancy,
and his only obligation is to follow the highest law of his being.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_113" title="pg 113"></a>
You have one supreme duty above all creeds and conventions&mdash;namely,
to think honestly, and say what you think.
</p>

<p>Have you doubts about your creed? say so; only thus has the true faith
ever advanced.
</p>

<p>It is not God, but the devil, who whispers: "Think at your peril!"</p>

<p>Do you see flaws in the ancient structure of respectability and law and
order? Say so; only thus has the condition of man ever improved.
</p>

<p>Have courage to be the heretic and traitor that you are by nature, and
do not worry about the consequences.
</p>

<p>Be a creator, as you were born to be, and spurn beyond all infamies the
wretched role of a repeater and apologist.

<h4>Exercise 8</h4>

<p>Underscore all the verbs in the following and note the participles,
the infinitives and the various time forms; also the helping verbs:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the net purport of war?
To my knowledge, for example, there dwell and toil, in the British village
of Dumrudge, usually some five hundred souls. From these, by certain
'natural enemies' of the French, there are selected, say thirty able-bodied men;
Dumrudge, at her own expense, has suckled and nursed them; she has, not without
difficulty and sorrow, fed them up to manhood and trained them in the
crafts, so that one can weave, another build and another hammer. Nevertheless,
amidst much weeping and swearing, they are selected; all dressed in red
and shipped away, at the public charges, some two thousand miles, or, say
only to the south of Spain, and fed there till wanted. And now to that same spot
in the south of Spain are thirty similar French artisans, in like manner,
wending their ways; till at length the thirty stand facing the thirty, each with
his gun in his hand. Straightway, the word 'Fire' is given, and they blow the
souls out of one another; and in the place of the sixty brisk, useful
craftsmen, the world has sixty dead carcasses, which it must bury and anew shed tears
for.</p>

<p>Had these men any quarrel? Busy as the devil is, not the smallest! They
lived far enough apart; were the entirest strangers; nay, in so wide a
universe, there was even, unconsciously, by commerce, some mutual helpfulness
between them.</p>

<p>How then?</p>

<p>Simpleton! Their governors had fallen out; and instead of shooting one
another, had these poor blockheads shoot.

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 11</h2>

<p>There are but few rules which can be learned to aid in the spelling
of English words. The spelling of words must be largely mastered by
concentration and effort of the memory. It will help you to memorize
the correct spelling if you will write each word a number of times. This
gives you a visual image of the word. Then spell it aloud a number
of times. This will give you an auditory image.
</p>

<p>Words which you find difficult to master, write in a list by themselves
and review frequently. There are a few rules, however, which
are helpful to know. There is one rule of spelling we want to learn this
week concerning words formed by adding a suffix.
</p>


<p><b>A word of one syllable which ends in a single consonant before
which stands a single vowel, doubles the final consonant when a
suffix beginning with a vowel is added.</b>
</p>

<p>For example: <i>mat</i>, <i>matted</i>, <i>matting</i>; <i>sun</i>,
<i>sunned</i>, <i>sunning</i>.
</p>

<p><i>Mat</i> ends in <i>t</i>, a single consonant which is preceded by the
single vowel <i>a</i>,&mdash;so you double the <i>t</i> when you add the suffix
<i>ed</i> or <i>ing</i>, which begin with a vowel.
</p>

<p>Notice these: <i>Blend</i>, <i>blended</i>, <i>blending</i>;
<i>Help</i>, <i>helped</i>, <i>helping</i>.
</p>

<p>These words do not end in a single consonant, so you do not double
the consonant.
</p>

<p>Notice also: <i>Lean</i>, <i>leaned</i>, <i>leaning</i>; <i>Rain</i>,
<i>rained</i>, <i>raining</i>.
</p>

<p>These words end in a single consonant, but before the consonant
is a double vowel, <i>ea</i> in <i>lean</i> and <i>ai</i> in
<i>rain</i>. So we do not double the
final consonant.
</p>

<p>This same rule holds true of any suffix, beginning with a vowel, as
<i>er</i> and <i>est</i>, for example: <i>sad</i>, <i>sadder</i>,
<i>saddest</i>. <i>Slim</i>, <i>slimmer</i>, <i>slimmest</i>.
</p>

<p>Learn to spell the following words. Add the suffixes <i>ed</i> and
<i>ing</i> to
the words for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Add <i>er</i> and
<i>est</i> to the
words for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
</p>

<p><b>Monday</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Chat</li>
<li>Cheat</li>
<li>Grin</li>
<li>Groan</li>
<li>Suit</li>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 12</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this lesson we are beginning the study of still another part of
speech. You will notice that in words, at least, we give credit and place
in society only because of <i>work performed</i>. In the society of men,
people are given place and position too often because of outward dress
and form or because of some special privilege. They are not given
their place in society because of the work which they do or because they
perform any useful function. In fact, in our topsy-turvy world, those
who perform no work at all, but are simply parasites upon society, have
claimed for themselves the best of everything and the highest positions.
</p>

<p>Surely some time we shall see a society as successfully organized
as our society of words, when men will be received, not because of that
which they possess, but because of that which they do and are. Man
has really laid the foundation for an ideal commonwealth in his organization
of words into a spoken and written language.
</p>

<p>When we think back across the centuries and think of the primitive
man as he dwelt in trees to protect himself from the wild animals, we
wonder what sort of speech he used then. Possibly it was only a little
more articulate than the speech of some animals.
</p>

<p>But man had within him the instinct to question, and this has
been the root of all his progress. We can imagine these primitive men
witnessing the wonder of fire, as the terrible unknown god of the lightning
set fire to the forest in which they lived; but after the fear had
subsided, some adventurous, inquiring forefather of ours ventured near
the ashes, and began to investigate concerning this fearful and wonderful thing.
</p>

<p>So gradually they discovered the use of fire, and with it a wonderful
new future opened before the primitive man. With these great discoveries,
he needed a better form of communication with his comrades,
so articulate speech developed. But when we go back into the beginning
of written speech, it is difficult for us to trace it to its beginning.
</p>

<p>The first evidence we find was of man as a sign maker. On the
walls of caves in France and Belgium and here in America, we have
found rude sketches which the scientists tell us date back to the Ice Age
and the Old Stone Age. Here the primitive man has drawn for us crude
pictures describing different phases of his life, the animals about him,
the hunt and the chase, and in these pictures we find the very beginning
of our alphabet of to-day.
</p>

<p>How much more wonderful it makes our spoken and written language
to know that man has developed it himself. It has not been
handed down by some god or powers above; but the spirit of rebellion
against the things that be; the great desire to know more and to find
out the reason <i>why</i> of all the things around us,&mdash;these have been the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_116" title="pg 116"></a>
forces that have led the race from the animal-like beings that lived in
trees to the race of today that understands in a large measure the laws
that govern life.
</p>

<p>It is only as we, through this spirit of rebellion, this same divine
discontent with the things that are, seek to do our own thinking that
we can add our share to the heritage of the race. Let us have the same
courage that must have inspired the heart of that primitive man who
dared to venture and inquire concerning the fearful things of nature
round about him. Let us think for ourselves. Ask always the question
"why" and demand the reason for all things. Thus we shall free ourselves
and help to free the race.

<h3>IN PLACE OF A NOUN</h3>

<p><b id="sec_202">202.</b> You remember in our study of the parts of speech we found
that we have one part of speech that can be used in place of a noun.
This is a very helpful part of speech for it saves us a great deal of
tiresome repetition. Notice the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>John Smith is a machinist.</li>
<li>John Smith works at the machine.</li>
<li>The machine is John Smith's master.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is awkward and the repetition is tiresome. So we say instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Smith is a machinist.</li>
<li>He works at the machine.</li>
<li>It is his master.</li>
</ul>

<p>You readily understand who and what we mean by <i>he</i> and <i>it</i> and
<i>his</i>, and we will all agree that the latter is a much better way of making
the statements. These words like <i>he</i> and <i>his</i> and <i>it</i>, which we use in
place of the noun, we call <i>pronouns</i>. <i>Pro</i> means literally in the Latin,
<i>for</i> or <i>in place of</i>; so when we say pronoun we are practically saying, in
place of a noun.
</p>

<p><b>A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_203">203.</b> The word for which a pronoun stands or the noun in whose
place it is used is called its antecedent. <i>Ante</i> means
<i>before</i> and <i>cedent</i>
comes from the Latin word meaning <i>go</i>, hence antecedent means literally,
<i>going before</i>.
</p>

<p>Notice this sentence: <i>The manager spoke to the men before he left
and told them to stop at the office.</i> <i>Manager</i> is the
antecedent of the pronoun
<i>he</i>, and <i>men</i> is the antecedent of the pronoun <i>them</i>.
</p>

<p><b>The word for which a pronoun stands is called its antecedent.</b></p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_117" title="pg 117"></a>
KINDS OF PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_204">204.</b> The Latin language has had a great deal of influence upon
English. Many of our words are taken from the Latin. You remember
that all of the names of our parts of speech are derived from Latin
words. We also feel the influence of the Latin language in the way in
which we number our personal pronouns. The Romans naturally thought
that one would think of one's self first, and so the pronouns referring
to one's self, or the person speaking, are called the <i>first</i>
person pronouns.
They are, <i>I</i>, <i>my</i>, <i>mine</i>, <i>me</i> and <i>we</i>,
<i>our</i>, <i>ours</i>, and <i>us</i>.
</p>

<p>Then they naturally thought that one would think second of the
person spoken to, so the pronouns referring to the person spoken to
are called the <i>second</i> person pronouns. Formerly <i>thou</i> was used in
speaking to one person. In German and many other languages this
form is still used, but in English we do not today use the singular form
<i>thou</i> with its variations, <i>thy</i>, <i>thine</i>, and
<i>thee</i>, except in poetry or poetic
prose. In every-day speech we use <i>you</i> and its forms, <i>your</i>
and <i>yours</i>,
for both the singular and the plural.
</p>

<p>Then the Romans considered last the person or thing of whom they
were speaking; so pronouns referring to the person or thing spoken of
are called the <i>third</i> person pronouns. These are <i>he</i>,
<i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>, with
their other forms, <i>his</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>hers</i>,
<i>its</i>, in the singular, and <i>they</i>, <i>their</i>,
<i>theirs</i> and <i>them</i> in the plural.
</p>

<p><b>A personal pronoun is one that denotes the speaker, the person
spoken to, or the person or thing spoken of.</b>
</p>

<h3>COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_205">205.</b> All of these forms of pronouns which we have named are
simple forms; but we have several personal pronouns which have a
compound form; that is, a form made by the addition of <i>self</i> or
<i>selves</i> to the simple forms.
</p>

<p>These are called compound personal pronouns. They are, in the
singular, <i>myself</i>, <i>thyself</i>, <i>yourself</i>,
<i>himself</i>, <i>herself</i>, <i>itself</i>, and in the
plural, <i>ourselves</i>, <i>yourselves</i> and <i>themselves</i>.
</p>

<p>The compound personal pronouns have two uses, reflexive and emphatic.</p>


<h4>Reflexive</h4>

<p><b id="sec_206">206.</b> A compound personal pronoun has a reflexive use when the
actor becomes the object of its own action or in other words when the
subject and the object refer to the same thing; as in this sentence,
<i>He has hurt himself</i>, <i>himself</i> is the object of the
incomplete verb <i>has
hurt</i>, but it refers to the subject <i>he</i>. Reflexive is from the
Latin <i>re</i>
meaning <i>back</i> and from the Latin verb meaning <i>throw</i>, so
reflexive means
literally <i>thrown</i> back. These pronouns throw their meaning back to
the subject.
</p>

<h4>Emphatic</h4>

<p><b id="sec_207">207.</b> A compound personal pronoun has also an emphatic use when
it directs especial attention to the noun or pronoun to which it refers.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_118" title="pg 118"></a>
For example in the sentence, <i>He did the work himself</i>, or, <i>He,
himself, did the work</i>, <i>himself</i> gives emphasis or intensifies the
meaning of the pronoun <i>he</i>.
</p>

<p>Remember a compound personal pronoun is correctly used only
in these two ways, reflexive and emphatic. For example, the following
sentences are incorrect:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This is for yourself and your comrade.</li>
<li>Ourselves will find out the reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct form would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is for you and your comrade.</li>
<li>We, ourselves, will find out the reason.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_208">208.</b> You can readily distinguish between the reflexive and the
emphatic use. In the reflexive, the compound personal pronoun is
always the <i>object</i> of a verb or preposition, and the subject of the sentence
is its antecedent. The subject and the object always refer to the same thing.
</p>

<p>In the emphatic use, the compound personal pronoun is neither the
subject nor the object, but is thrown into the sentence simply to render
it emphatic, and to call special attention to its antecedent.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Supply the compound personal pronoun in the following blanks
and tell whether the use is reflexive or emphatic.</p>

<ol>
<li>He discovered the truth.......</li>
<li>The workers have robbed......by their ignorance.</li>
<li>You must educate.......</li>
<li>You must do the work.......</li>
<li>He must defend.......</li>
<li>Capitalism overreaches.......</li>
<li>The people will rule.......</li>
<li>We will settle the question.......</li>
</ol>

<p>Write six sentences in which the compound personal pronouns are
correctly used.</p>


<h3>SINGULAR AND PLURAL</h3>

<p><b id="sec_209">209.</b> Personal pronouns, like nouns, have number form. Nouns
simply add <i>s</i> to the singular form to denote the plural, but in personal
pronouns we have different words which we use to express one or more
than one person or thing. In the first, second, and third person forms,
personal pronouns also have different forms for the object form, the
possessive and the subject form. The following table gives the singular
and plural of the subject form,&mdash;that is the form which is used as the
subject of the sentence.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_119" title="pg 119"></a></p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="3">Subject Form</th></tr>

<tr><th colspan="2" align="center" class="sub">Singular</th>   <th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>First person.</i></td>        <td> I </td>            <td>We</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Second person.</i></td>         <td>You </td>         <td>You</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Third person.</i></td>      <td>He, she, it.</td> <td>They</td></tr>
</table>

<tr><th colspan="3">Compound Personal Pronouns</th></tr>

<tr><th colspan="2" align="center" class="sub">Singular</th>
<th class="sub">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>First.</i></td>        <td>Myself</td>          <td>Ourselves</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Second.</i></td>       <td>Yourself</td>          <td>Yourselves</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Third.</i> </td>       <td>Himself, herself, itself.</td>       <td>Themselves</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_210">210.</b> Remember that the first person refers to the person speaking,
the second to the person spoken to, and the third person to the person
or things spoken of. When we speak of things, we never use the first
or second person, unless we are speaking of them in a personified form.
So in the third person singular, we have the pronoun <i>it</i> which refers to
one thing. In the plural, we have no special pronoun referring to things,
but the pronoun <i>they</i> is used to refer both to persons and things.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Which of the following pronouns refer to the person speaking,
which to the person spoken to, and which to the person or thing spoken
of? Which are singular, which plural?
</p>

<ul>
<li>I will defend my principles.</li>
<li>Give them to me for they are mine.</li>
<li>Do you believe him to be your friend?</li>
<li>We saw their mistake at once.</li>
<li>They acknowledged it was their fault.</li>
<li>Success will be your portion if you persevere.</li>
<li>He struggles for his rights; she does not understand her rights.</li>
<li>It forces us to struggle for our education.</li>
<li>Woman craves her freedom.</li>
<li>Workers of the world, unite; you have a world to gain and nothing to
lose but your chains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Form sentences of your own containing all these pronouns.</p>


<h3>POSSESSIVE FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_211">211.</b> You will note in these sentences above that we have used the
pronoun <i>my</i> and <i>your</i> and <i>his</i> and <i>her</i> as <i>my
principles</i>, <i>your friend</i>,
<i>his rights</i>, <i>her freedom</i>. This is the possessive form of these personal
pronouns, the form that denotes ownership or possession. You remember
that nouns had a possessive form, a form to denote possession or
ownership, as, <i>The man's book</i>. <i>The boy's school.</i> <i>The worker's college.</i>
So pronouns also have a possessive form which we use to show that an
object belongs to such and such a person or thing. If I want to tell
you that I own or possess a home, I say, <i>I own my home</i>. Each personal
pronoun has its possessive form, thus:

<h3>POSSESSIVE FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_212">212.</b> You will notice that the possessive forms, <i>my</i>,
<i>our</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>your</i>,
<i>its</i>, <i>his</i> and <i>their</i>, are always used with the name
of the object possessed.
As for example; <i>my work</i>, <i>our library</i>, <i>her delight</i>,
<i>your task</i>, <i>its purpose</i>,
<i>his home</i>, <i>their mistake</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_213">213.</b> The possessive forms, <i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>,
<i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i> and <i>theirs</i>,
are always used by themselves and are used either as subject, object or
complement. As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>That letter is mine.</li>
<li>The work is hers.</li>
<li>Thine is the glory.</li>
<li>Is that yours?</li>
<li>Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die.</li>
</ul>

<p>The possessive form <i>his</i> may be used either in connection with the
name of the object possessed or by itself. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This is <i>his</i> home.</li>
<li>This home is <i>his</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OBJECT FORM</h3>

<p><b id="sec_214">214.</b> Pronouns have one form which nouns do not have. We use
the same form for the noun no matter whether it is the subject or the
object. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man saw me.</li>
<li>I saw the man.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence <i>man</i> is the subject of the verb <i>saw</i>, and in the
second sentence <i>man</i> is the object of the verb <i>saw</i>. The same word is
used; but you will notice that in the first sentence <i>me</i> is the object
of the verb <i>saw</i>, and in the second <i>I</i> is the subject; yetboth refer to the
same person, the first person, the person speaking.
</p>

<p>So we have a different form of the pronoun for the object, for
example: <i>I saw him.</i> <i>He saw me.</i> <i>She watched us.</i> <i>We watched her.</i>
<i>You found them.</i> <i>Him</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>us</i>, <i>her</i>, and
<i>them</i> in these sentences are
used as the objects of the verbs, <i>see</i>, <i>watch</i> and
<i>found</i>, and are called the
object forms of the pronouns. <i>You</i> and <i>it</i> have the same form for both
the subject and object; as, <i>You did it.</i> <i>It frightens you.</i> <i>Her</i> is used
as both the possessive form and the object form, as, <i>Her work tires her.</i>
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_121" title="pg 121"></a>
<b id="sec_215">215.</b> The following table gives the subject and the object forms
of the personal pronouns, and these should never be confused in their
usage. We must not use the object form as the subject of the verb,
nor the subject form as the object of the verb.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Singular</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Subject</th>           <th class="sub">Object</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>First.</i>  I</td>             <td>Me</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Second.</i> You</td>           <td>You</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Third.</i> He, she, it.</td>   <td>Him, her, it</td></tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Plural</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Subject</th>           <th class="sub">Object</th></tr>

<tr><td><i>First.</i>  We </td>          <td> Us</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Second.</i> You</td>           <td>You</td></tr>

<tr><td><i>Third.</i> They</td>           <td>Them</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>GENDER</h3>

<p><b id="sec_216">216.</b> You notice in all of these tables that there are three forms
given for the third person singular, <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and
<i>it</i>. These are the only
forms in which pronouns express gender. In all other forms the gender
can be determined only by the gender of the antecedent.
</p>

<p><b>He, representing a male, is masculine.</b></p>

<p><b>She, representing a female, is the feminine.</b></p>

<p><b>It represents a sexless thing, and hence is said to be of the
neuter gender.</b></p>


<h3>THE LITTLE VERB <i>BE</i></h3>

<p><b id="sec_217">217.</b> You remember when we studied verbs, we had the incomplete
verb that took an object; the complete verb that needed no object,
since it was complete in itself; and one other kind of a verb. Do you
remember this third kind of verb? This third kind is the copulative
verb, and the copulative verb which we use most frequently is the one
in the use of which we make the most mistakes.
</p>

<p>It is that troublesome, bothersome, little verb <i>be</i>, which is so
difficult
to master. You remember it is an incomplete verb, but instead of
taking an object, it takes a complement or completing word. So when
you see a pronoun with any form of this verb <i>be</i>, you must use the
<i>subject</i>
form and not the <i>object</i> form. This copulative verb <i>be</i> is
simply a
connecting word, not a verb that asserts action or takes an object.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_218">218.</b> Here is where we make so many mistakes. We say, <i>It was
me</i>, <i>It was them</i>, <i>It was him</i>, <i>It wasn't her</i>;
instead of, <i>It was I</i>, <i>It was
they</i>, <i>It was he</i>, <i>It wasn't she</i>. We have used the
incorrect form in this
particular so often that the correct form has a strange sound to our
ears.
</p>

<p>The only way to remedy this is to repeat over and over aloud the
correct form until it has a familiar sound. Don't think this is putting
on airs. It is not. It is simply demanding the best for yourself in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_122" title="pg 122"></a>
words, as you should do in everything. We of the working class have
built the world in its beauty. Why should we live in shacks, dress in
shoddy, talk in slang? There is no reason except that we endure it.
When the united working class demands its own, it will receive it.
Demand yours and arouse the stupid from their sleep as rapidly as you
can.
</p>

<p>Repeat the following sentences aloud ten times every day this week
and see if the correct form does not come to your lips more readily.
We can learn the rule, but only continued practice and watchfulness
can break us of our old habits.
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is I who seek my own.</li>
<li>It shall be they who are defeated.</li>
<li>It was I who was ignorant.</li>
<li>It is they who cause all wars.</li>
<li>It is he who must be aroused.</li>
<li>It is we who strive for freedom.</li>
<li>It shall be I who shall win.</li>
<li>It was she who was enslaved.</li>
<li>It shall be we who shall demand equality.</li>
<li>It shall be they who shall conquer.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Agreement</h4>

<p><b id="sec_219">219.</b> Pronouns are very agreeable members of the co-operative
commonwealth of words. They strive to agree with their antecedents.
Sometimes we do not allow the pronoun to agree, and then our sentence
is incorrect.
</p>

<p><b>A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number, gender
and person.</b>
</p>

<p>For example, if you are referring to one man, you must use a masculine
pronoun, singular, third person form, as <i>I saw the man but he did
not see me</i>. <i>Man</i> is the antecedent. It is singular, masculine, third
person and so we use the pronoun <i>he</i>.
</p>

<p><i>The girl came, but she could not stay.</i> In this sentence <i>girl</i> is the
antecedent; it is singular, feminine, third person, and so we use the
pronoun <i>she</i>.
</p>

<p><i>The boys did not come when the teacher called them.</i> In this sentence
<i>boys</i> is the antecedent; it is plural, masculine, third person, and so
we use the pronoun <i>them</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_220">220.</b> <b>Sometimes there are two words used as the antecedent,
joined by</b> <i>and</i>. We use a singular pronoun in referring to them if they
denote the same person or thing; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The secretary and treasurer (one person) resigned <i>his</i> position.</li>
<li>My comrade and friend (one person) gave me <i>his</i> help.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_221">221.</b> <b>But two nouns joined by</b> <i>and</i>, <b>that mean
different persons
or things, must be represented by a plural pronoun, thus</b>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Marx and Engels (two persons) wrote <i>their</i> call to liberty, the
Communist-Manifesto.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_123" title="pg 123"></a>
Men and women will struggle for <i>their</i> freedom.</li>
<li>Childhood and youth should have <i>their</i> rightful joys.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_222">222.</b> <b>Use the singular pronoun when the nouns are kept separate
by the use of</b> <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>many a</i>, or
<i>no</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Each man and boy must do <i>his</i> part. (Not <i>their</i> part.)</li>
<li>Every soldier and every officer must do <i>his</i> duty.</li>
<li>Many a city and many a village gave <i>its</i> best to the army.</li>
<li>No comrade and no Socialist will give <i>his</i> consent to war.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_223">223.</b> <b>If you have two singular nouns as antecedents, joined
by</b> <i>or</i>, <b>or</b> <i>nor</i>, <b>use the singular pronoun</b>, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Either Germany or France must abandon <i>its</i> position.</li>
<li>Neither Wilson nor Bryan kept <i>his</i> promise to the people.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_224">224.</b> <b>When you use a collective noun and are speaking of the
collection as a whole, use a singular pronoun</b>, as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The committee will make <i>its</i> report.</li>
<li>The audience was hearty in <i>its</i> appreciation.</li>
<li>The jury has returned <i>its</i> verdict.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_225">225.</b> <b>But if you are referring to the individuals of the
collection separately, use a plural pronoun</b>; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The committee adjourned for <i>their</i> dinner.</li>
<li>The audience kept <i>their</i> seats until the close.</li>
<li>The jury argued until <i>their</i> nerves were on edge.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PERSONIFICATION</h3>

<p><b id="sec_226">226.</b> We sometimes speak of things as if they were persons, and
so use either masculine or feminine pronouns in referring to them.
Such objects are said to be personified. Thus, we say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The sun his ceaseless course doth run.</li>
<li>The moon sheds her silvery ray.</li>
<li>Nature dons her robes of green.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we speak of the sun as though it were a man or possessing the
qualities of a man and use the pronoun <i>his</i>. Then we speak of the
moon and nature as though they were women and use the pronoun in the
feminine form.
</p>

<h3>REMEMBER</h3>

<p><b id="sec_227">227.</b> <b>A pronoun must agree with its antecedent.</b></p>

<p><b>Use the subject form of the pronoun if the pronoun is the subject
of the sentence.</b></p>

<p><b>Use the object form when the pronoun is the object of a verb
or a preposition.</b></p>

<p><b>Use the compound personal pronouns only in their reflexive or
emphatic use.</b></p>

<p><b>With all forms of the verb</b> <i>be</i>, <b>use the subject form of
the pronouns.</b>
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Read carefully the following beautiful dream of Olive Schreiner's.
Mark all of the personal pronouns and note carefully their use and by
referring to the table above decide just what form each pronoun is.
Watch carefully too for the antecedents of the pronouns and note the
agreement of the pronoun with its antecedent.

<h4>"I THOUGHT I STOOD"</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>I thought I stood in Heaven before God's throne, and God asked me what
I had come for. I said I had come to arraign my brother, Man.</p>

<p>God said, "What has he done?"</p>

<p>I said, "He has taken my sister, Woman, and has stricken her and
wounded her and thrust her out into the streets; she lies there
prostrate. His
hands are red with blood. I am here to arraign him; that the kingdom be
taken from him, because he is not worthy, and given unto me. My hands
are pure."</p>

<p>I showed them.</p>

<p>God said, "Thy hands are pure. Lift up thy robe."</p>

<p>I raised it; my feet were red, blood-red, as if I had trodden in wine.</p>

<p>God said, "How is this?"</p>

<p>I said, "Dear Lord, the streets on earth are full of mire. If I should
walk straight on in them my outer robe might be bespotted, you see how
white it is! Therefore I pick my way."</p>

<p>God said, "<i>On what?</i>"</p>

<p>I was silent, and let my robe fall. I wrapped my mantle about my
head. I went out softly. I was afraid that the angels would see me.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>Once more I stood at the gate of Heaven, I and another. We held fast
by one another; We were very tired. We looked up at the great gates; angels
opened them, and we went in. The mud was on our garments. We walked
across the marble floor, and up to the great throne. Then the angels divided
us. Her, they set upon the top step, but me, upon the bottom; for, they said,
"Last time this woman came here she left red foot-marks on the floor; we had
to wash them out with our tears. Let her not go up."</p>

<p>Then she with whom I came, looked back and stretched out her hands to
me; and I went and stood beside her. And the angels, they, the shining ones
<a class="pagenum" id="page_125" title="pg 125"></a>
who never sinned and never suffered, walked by us, to and fro, up and down;
I think we should have felt a little lonely there if it had not been for one
another, the angels were so bright.</p>

<p>God asked me what I had come for; and I drew my sister forward a
little that He might see her.</p>

<p>God said, "How is it you are here together today?"</p>

<p>I said, "She was upon the ground in the street, and they passed over
her; I lay down by her, and she put her arms around my neck, and so I lifted
her, and we two rose together."</p>

<p>God said, "Whom are you now come to accuse before Me?"</p>

<p>I said, "We are come to accuse no man."</p>

<p>And God bent and said, "My children&mdash;what is it that you seek?"</p>

<p>And she beside me drew my hand that I should speak for both.</p>

<p>I said, "We have come to ask that Thou shouldst speak to Man, our
brother, and give us a message for him that he might understand, and
that he might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>God said, "Go, take the message down to him!"</p>

<p>I said, "But what <i>is</i> the message?"</p>

<p>God said, "Upon your hearts it is written; take it down to him."</p>

<p>And we turned to go; the angels went with us to the door. They looked
at us.</p>

<p>And one said, "Ah! but their dresses are beautiful!"</p>

<p>And the other said, "I thought it was mire when they came in, but
see, it is all golden!"</p>

<p>But another said, "Hush, it is the light from their faces!"</p>

<p>And we went down to him.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Olive Schreiner.</i></span></p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 12</h2>

<p>Last week we learned the rule governing the spelling of derivatives
of <i>one</i> syllable ending in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel
when we add a suffix beginning with a vowel.
</p>

<p>The same rule applies to words of two or more syllables, accented
on the last syllable.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Compel</i>, compelled, compelling.</li>
<li><i>Prefer</i>, preferred, preferring.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Words accented on the last syllable, when they end in a single
consonant preceded by a single vowel, double the final consonant
when you add a suffix beginning with a vowel.</b>
</p>

<p>When these words take a suffix that begins with a <i>consonant</i>, they
do <i>not</i> double the final consonant; as, <i>preferment</i>.
</p>

<p>Words accented on any syllable but the last, do <i>not</i> double the
final consonant; as, <i>offer</i>, <i>offered</i>, <i>offering</i>.
</p>

<p>Words that have two vowels before a single final consonant do
not double the final consonant; as, <i>reveal</i>, <i>revealed</i>,
<i>revealing</i>.
</p>

<p>Words that end in a double consonant or any two consonants,
keep the two consonants, no matter what suffix they take; as,
<i>indent</i>,
<i>indented</i>; <i>skill</i>, <i>skilled</i>, <i>skillful</i>.
</p>

<p>The only exception to this rule is when the addition of the suffix
throws the accent back to a preceding syllable. When this is the case,
the final consonant is not doubled. For example: <i>refer</i>,
<i>referred</i>, <i>ref'erence</i>;
<i>confer</i>, <i>conferring</i>, <i>con'ference</i>.
</p>

<p>Look up the following words in the dictionary, watch for the accent,
mark and add the suffixes, <i>ed</i>, <i>ing</i>, <i>ence</i> or
<i>ance</i>, if possible.
</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 13</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>Did you ever tie a knot in your handkerchief to help you remember
to get something you felt almost sure you would forget? Well, tying
a knot in a cord was one of the first ways devised by our ancestors of
long ago to aid them to remember. They also used this plan to send
word to those at a distance or to keep track of things for succeeding
generations. A relic of this old device of our forefathers is also found
in the rosary on which the Roman Catholic counts his beads as an aid
to memory.
</p>

<p>There are some primitive tribes to-day who still
use knotted strings
as an aid to memory. These consist of a main cord, and fastened at
given distances are finer cords of different colors. Each cord is knotted
in different ways to mean different things and each color, too, has its
own meaning. A red string stands for soldiers, a yellow for gold, and
a green for corn, and so on, while a single knot may mean ten, two
single knots twenty, a double knot 100, two double knots 200. In this
way, they keep a record of things, transmit orders and use them for
various purposes.
</p>

<p>Only a generation ago the tax gatherers in the Island of Hawaii
kept account of the assessable property on lines of cordage knotted in
this manner, and these cords in some cases were three thousand feet long.
The method of keeping track of things by means of a notched stick is
easily within the memory of many people living today. For in England
in the early part of the last century, accounts of debts to the government
were kept by means of tally sticks, which were merely notched sticks.
</p>

<p>Such methods as these were the only ways primitive man had of
keeping track of things before he had discovered the art of written
speech. And even after written speech was known and used, these old
methods persisted.
</p>

<p>Gradually, step by step, man has come along the path of progress.
Adventurous spirits, not satisfied with the old way of doing things,
sought new ways. The conservatives of their day thought them dangerous
people, no doubt, and feared that they would destroy the very foundations
of society. And this they oft-times did, but only that there might
rise a more perfect form of society. It is the seeking, questioning mind
that demands the reason for all things, that seeks ever better ways of
doing things. They have always throughout the ages refused to bow
to the authority of the past but have dared to live their own lives. To
them we owe the progress of the world and we are the inheritors of
their spirit.
</p>

<p>Let us prove our kinship by daring to live our own lives and think
our own thoughts.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_128" title="pg 128"></a>
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_228">228</b>. You recall that in our first lesson we studied concerning the
four different kinds of sentences which we use in expressing our
thoughts, the <i>assertive</i>, the <i>interrogative</i>, the
<i>imperative</i> and the <i>exclamatory</i>.
The interrogative sentence is the form which we use in asking a
question, <i>interrogative</i> being derived from the Latin
<i>inter</i>, meaning <i>between</i>,
and <i>rogare</i>, <i>to ask</i>, meaning literally <i>to ask
between</i>. The interrogative
sentence differs from the assertive sentence in the arrangement
of the words; for in order to ask questions, we usually place the
predicate,
or part of it at least, before the subject, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Can</i> you <i>use</i> good English?</li>
<li><i>Did</i> you <i>spell</i> the word correctly?</li>
<li><i>Has</i> he <i>studied</i> grammar?</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, you note that the helping verbs, <i>can</i>,
<i>did</i> and <i>has</i>,
are placed first instead of the subject. It is by this arrangement that
we put the sentence in the interrogative form.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_229">229.</b> Frequently, however, in asking questions we wish to ask concerning
a person or thing whose name we do not know. So we need
a word to refer to the unknown object. See how these uses of words
grow out of our need! We have three interrogative pronouns, <i>who</i> and
<i>which</i> and <i>what</i>, that we use to meet this need. Notice the use of these
three pronouns in the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Who</i> wrote the Communist Manifesto?</li>
<li><i>Which</i> of the two men is the better known?</li>
<li><i>What</i> are the closing words of this famous document?</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, <i>who</i> and <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> are the interrogative
pronouns, used to ask questions concerning the unknown persons or objects.</p>

<p><b id="sec_230">230.</b> <b>Who refers only to human beings or to personified
objects.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Which refers either to human beings, animals or things.</b></p>

<p><b>What refers only to things.</b></p>

<p><i>Which</i> and <i>what</i> have the same form for both the subject and the
object. <i>Who</i> has a different form for all three forms, the subject form,
the possessive form, and the object form. It uses the same form, however,
both in singular and plural.</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Subject form</th> <th class="sub">Possessive form</th> <th class="sub">Object form</th> </tr>
<tr>    <td>Who</td>              <td>Whose</td>            <td>Whom</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_231">231.</b> We often make mistakes in the use of the different forms of
the pronoun <i>who</i>. We often use the subject form for the object
form, using <i>who</i> where we should have used <i>whom</i>. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Who did you see?</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct form is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whom did you see?</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_129" title="pg 129"></a>
The pronoun <i>whom</i> is the object of the verb <i>see</i>, hence the object
form should be used. However, the use of the subject form <i>who</i> instead
of <i>whom</i> is coming into such general use today that some grammarians
accept it as a permissible usage. The will of the people influences
language, as it does all other human institutions, and gradually creates
new rules.
</p>

<p>Write three sentences, using <i>who</i>, <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> as
interrogative pronouns.
</p>

<p><b>An interrogative pronoun is a pronoun used to ask a question.</b></p>


<h3>RELATIVE PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_232">232.</b> There is one other class of pronouns which plays a great part
in our speech and is a wonderful help to us. For example, suppose I
want to tell you several things about this book. I say: <i>I am reading
this book. It interests me greatly.</i> Now it would be a great advantage
to me if I could put these two sentences together, and we have for this
use a pronoun which makes it possible for us to combine these sentences,
and so I say:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The book which I am reading interests me greatly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus I am able to unite two short sentences into a long sentence,
which conveys my meaning better than the two short sentences and
gives a smoother bit of reading. We have four pronouns which we use
in this way, <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i> and <i>what</i> and
they are called relative pronouns
because they refer or relate to some noun in the sentence and
they also serve to connect two statements.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_233">233.</b> <b>A relative pronoun is a pronoun that relates to an
antecedent and at the same time connects two statements.</b>
</p>

<p>A relative pronoun always relates to its antecedent and at the
same time connects the statement that it introduces with the one that
contains the antecedent to which it relates, as in the sentence above,
<i>The book which I am reading, interests me greatly.</i> <i>Which</i> is the relative
pronoun; first, because it relates to the antecedent, <i>book</i>; and second,
because it connects the statement, <i>I am reading</i>, with the rest of the sentence.
Notice these sentences also:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man who thinks will not enlist in the army.</li>
<li>We will destroy the system that enslaves us.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Who</i> and <i>that</i> are the relative pronouns in these two sentences and
their antecedents are <i>man</i> and <i>system</i>, and they connect the statements,
<i>who thinks</i> and <i>that enslaves us</i>, with the rest of the sentence.
</p>
<p><b id="sec_234">234.</b> <b>Who is used to relate to persons.</b></p>

<p><b>Which is used to relate only to animals and things.</b></p>

<p><b>That may relate to either persons, animals or things.</b></p>

<p><b>What relates to things.</b></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_130" title="pg 130"></a>
Note that <i>which</i>, as an interrogative, may refer to persons as well
as to animals and things; but as a relative, <i>which</i> never refers
to persons.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_235">235</b>. Note that we use the same pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i> and <i>what</i>
as both relative and interrogative pronouns. You will not be confused
in this matter if you will remember that they are called interrogative
pronouns only when they are used to ask questions. When they are
used as interrogative pronouns they never have an antecedent. <i>Who</i>
and <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> are always relative pronouns when used
in an assertive sentence and referring to an antecedent.
</p>

<p><i>That</i> and <i>what</i> have the same form for both the subject and object
forms. They have no possessive form. <i>Who</i> has a different form for
the subject form and the possessive form and the object form. <i>Which</i>
has the same form for subject and object forms, and a different form
for the possessive form. Note the following:
</p>
<table>
<tr>  <th class="sub">Subject form</th>    <th class="sub">Possessive form</th>  <th class="sub">Object form</th></tr>
<tr>       <td>who</td>             <td>whose</td>            <td>whom</td></tr>
<tr>       <td>which</td>           <td>whose</td>            <td>which</td></tr>
</table>

<ul>
<li>I know the man <i>who</i> called him.</li>
<li>I know the man <i>whose</i> voice I hear.</li>
<li>I know the man <i>whom</i> they called.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these three sentences we have the pronoun <i>who</i> used in its
three forms, subject, possessive and object form. We should be very careful
not to confuse the subject and the object forms of the pronoun <i>who</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the book <i>which</i> tells the truth.</li>
<li>This is the book <i>whose</i> author is in prison.</li>
<li>This is the book <i>which</i> I wanted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these three sentences we have the pronoun <i>which</i> used in its three
forms, <i>subject</i> form, <i>possessive</i> form and <i>object</i>
form. In the first sentence
the pronoun is the subject of the verb <i>tells</i>; in the second sentence,
it is used in the possessive form with the noun <i>author</i>; in the
third sentence, it is used as the object of the verb <i>wanted</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_236">236.</b> <i>What</i> differs from the other relative pronouns in that its
antecedent is never expressed, for it is implied in the word itself. <i>What</i>
is always equivalent to <i>that which</i>, or <i>the thing which</i>. For example,
the sentence, <i>Do not tell what I have told you</i>, is equivalent to saying,
<i>Do not tell that which I have told you</i>, or <i>the thing which I
have told you</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_237">237</b>. Never use <i>what</i> in a sentence as a <i>relative</i>
pronoun unless you
can replace it and make good sense by using <i>that which</i>, or <i>the
thing which</i> in place of <i>what</i>.
</p>

<p>For example, do not say, <i>I know that what he would say</i>. This is
incorrect. You should say, <i>I know that which he would say</i>, or <i>I know
what he would say</i>, using <i>what</i> in place of <i>that which</i>.
Here is a sentence
that occurred in an English examination recently, which illustrates most
aptly this point. <i>A subject is that what something is said about.</i>
Here <i>what</i> is used incorrectly. <i>A subject is that about which
something is said</i>, would have been the correct form.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_131" title="pg 131"></a>
Watch for this in your speech for it is a most common error and
to the educated ear is harsh and marks the speaker as uneducated.
All of these mistakes which we make so commonly will require a considerable
amount of effort to overcome, but the result is worth the effort,
for even those about us who will not take the pains or give the required
time and effort to acquiring an education for themselves, will give
greater heed to the speech of those who do speak correctly, and will
readily acknowledge the leadership of those who have given the time and
effort to self-development.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_238">238.</b> The antecedent of <i>who</i> is sometimes omitted and understood;
for example, <i>Who follows the cause must endure hardship</i>,
<i>He</i>, is understood
and omitted. <i>He who follows the cause must endure hardship.</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_239">239.</b> The relative pronoun itself is often omitted. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>These are the men (whom) you must help.</li>
<li>The words (that) you use and the deeds (that) you do, are your judges.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_240">240.</b> The relative pronouns have compound forms also, such as
<i>whoever</i>, <i>whosoever</i>, <i>whichever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>,
<i>whatever</i> and <i>whatsoever</i>,
which are used in the same manner as the simple forms.
</p>

<h3>COMMON ERRORS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_241">241.</b> Here are a number of common errors which only constant
practice and watchfulness can overcome. Study these over and watch
your conversation closely. Force yourself to speak correctly for a time,
and soon correct speech will become a habit.
</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <b>Do not use both a noun and a pronoun as the subject of a
sentence</b>; as, <i>John, he waited for me</i>. <i>Mary, she refused to go.</i> Leave
out the pronouns <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> in these sentences. They are unnecessary
and incorrect.
</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <b>Never use</b> <i>hern</i>, <i>ourn</i>, <i>hisn</i> or
<i>yourn</i> for <i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>his</i> and
<i>yours</i>; as, <i>The book is hisn</i>. <i>Ourn stopped on the
first.</i> <i>Did you get
yourn?</i> Say: <i>This book is his</i>. <i>Ours stopped on the
first.</i> <i>Did you get yours?</i>
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>Never say</b> <i>hisself</i> for <i>himself</i>. There is
no such word as <i>hisself</i>.
Do not say, <i>He hurt hisself</i>. Say, <i>He hurt himself</i>.
</p>

<p><b>4.</b> <b>Do not say</b> <i>them</i> for <i>those</i>; as, <i>Did you
bring them songs?</i>
<i>Them things are not right.</i> Say, <i>Did you bring those songs?</i>
<i>Those things are not right.</i>
</p>

<p><b>5.</b> <b>Do not use an apostrophe in writing the possessive forms
of pronouns</b>, as <i>her's</i>, <i>our's</i>, <i>it's</i>. Leave out
the apostrophe and write
<i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>its</i>.
</p>

<p><b>6.</b> <b>Do not use</b> <i>who</i> <b>to relate to animals or
things</b>; as, <i>The dog
who bit me was killed</i>. Say, <i>The dog that bit me was killed</i>.
</p>

<p><b>7.</b> <b>Do not use</b> <i>myself</i> <b>as the subject</b>. It can
be used only as an
emphatic or reflexive pronoun. It is correct to say, <i>I found the book
myself</i>, and <i>I hurt myself</i>. But do not say, <i>They asked my friend and
myself</i>, or <i>Myself and my wife will go</i>. Say, <i>They asked my friend
and me</i>. <i>My wife and I will go.</i>
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_132" title="pg 132"></a>
<b>8.</b> <b>Avoid the use of pronouns when the reference to the
antecedent
is not clear.</b> Better repeat the nouns or re-write the sentence.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He said to his friend that if he did not feel better soon he thought
he had better go home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can interpret this in at least four different ways. No one
but the speaker can ever know to whom the pronouns <i>he</i> refer,
whether to the speaker or to his friend. Or in the sentence,
</p>

<ul>
<li>A tried to see B in the crowd, but could not because he was so short.</li>
</ul>

<p>Who was short, <i>A</i> or <i>B</i>? <i>John's father died before he was born.</i>
Did John's father die before John was born or did John's father die
before John's father, himself, was born? Be careful in the use of
pronouns in this way.
</p>

<p><b>9.</b> <b>Remember that</b> <i>I</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>he</i>,
<i>she</i>, <i>they</i> <b>and</b> <i>who</i> <b>are always used as
subject forms and also as the complement of all forms of the verb</b>
<i>be</i>.
</p>

<p><b>10.</b> <b>Remember that</b> <i>me</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>her</i>,
<i>them</i>, <i>us</i> <b>and</b> <i>whom</i> <b>are always
object forms</b>. Never say, <i>They charged he and I too much</i>. Say,
<i>They charged him and me too much</i>. In an attempt to speak correctly
and follow the niceties of English, this mistake is so often made. Always
use the object form as the object of a verb or preposition.
</p>

<p><b>11.</b> <b>When a participle is used as a</b> <i>noun</i>, <b>and a
pronoun is used with it, the pronoun should always be in the</b> <i>possessive</i>
<b>form</b>. We make this mistake so frequently. For example, we say: <i>Us going there
was a mistake</i>. We should have used the possessive form, <i>Our going
there was a mistake</i>. <i>I have never known of him being absent from
work.</i> We should say: <i>I have never known of his being absent from
work</i>. <i>Did he tell you about me joining with them?</i> This should
be, <i>Did he tell you about my joining with them?</i> <i>You talking to him
set him to thinking.</i> This should be, <i>Your talking to him set him to
thinking</i>. Watch this and wherever you have used a participle as a <i>noun</i>, use
the pronoun in the <i>possessive</i> form, as you would with any other noun.
</p>

<p><b>12.</b> <b>Watch carefully that the number of the pronoun always
agrees with the number of its antecedent.</b> If you are speaking of
one person or thing use a singular pronoun. If you are speaking of
more than one person or thing in your antecedent, use the plural
pronoun. For example: <i>Each man must do his own work.</i> <i>The soldiers
fully understood their danger.</i>
</p>

<p><b>13.</b> <b>When a singular noun, in the common gender (this means
that it may name either a male or female being), is the antecedent
of the pronoun, it is customary for us to use the masculine pronoun.</b>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Every student should send in <i>his</i> examination paper promptly.</li>
<li>Every member of the class may select <i>his</i> own subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use the pronoun <i>their</i> when the antecedent is a singular noun.</p>

<h4>Exercise 11</h4>

<p>Note the omission of the antecedent in the first sentence, also the

immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore
if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of our own
mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.
I remember an answer which, when quite young, I was prompted to make to
a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines
of the church. On my saying, "What have I to do with the sacredness of
traditions, if I live wholly from within?" my friend suggested&mdash;"But these
impulses may be from below, not from above." I replied, "They do not seem
to me to be such; but if I am the devil's child, I will live then from the
devil." No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad
are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is
what is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it.
</p>
<p>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little
statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has
simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on
the wall. Out upon your guarded lips! Sew them up with pack threads, do.
Else, if you would be a man, speak what you think today in words as hard
as cannon balls, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words
again, though you contradict everything you said today. Ah, then, exclaim
the aged ladies, you shall be sure to be misunderstood. Misunderstood! It
is a right fool's word. Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras
was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and
Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To
be great is to be misunderstood."<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Emerson.</i></span></p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 13</h2>


<p>There are a few more rules governing the spelling of derivative
words. Words ending in silent <i>e</i> keep the <i>e</i> before the
suffix beginning with a consonant. Notice the following words:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>excite</td>     <td>excitement</td></tr>
<tr><td>like</td>       <td>likeness</td></tr>
<tr><td>force</td>      <td>forceful</td></tr>
<tr><td>shame</td>      <td>shameless</td></tr>
<tr><td>lone</td>       <td>lonesome</td></tr>
<tr><td>live</td>       <td>lively</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Words ending in silent <i>e</i> drop the <i>e</i> before the suffix
beginning with a vowel, as:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>excite</td>     <td>excitable</td></tr>
<tr><td>live</td>       <td>living</td></tr>
<tr><td>grieve</td>     <td>grievous</td></tr>
<tr><td>force</td>      <td>forcible</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some words ending in silent <i>e</i> retain the <i>e</i> before the
suffix beginning
with a vowel, to prevent a change in the pronunciation or to preserve
the identity of the word. Notice the following words:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>peace</td>     <td>peaceable</td></tr>
<tr><td>courage</td>   <td>courageous</td></tr>
<tr><td>singe</td>     <td>singeing</td></tr>
<tr><td>change</td>    <td>changeable</td></tr>
<tr><td>shoe</td>      <td>shoeing</td></tr>
<tr><td>notice</td>    <td>noticeable</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These are words ending in the soft sound of <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>, where the <i>e</i>
is retained to preserve the correct pronunciation of the <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>, and with
some few words like <i>toe</i>, <i>dye</i>, etc., where the dropping of
the <i>e</i> would lose the identity of the word.
</p>

<p>The <i>e</i> is dropped in a few words before the suffix beginning with
a consonant, as in <i>wholly</i>, <i>nursling</i>,
<i>judgment</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, <i>lodgment</i>.
</p>

<p>Add the suffixes <i>ment</i> and <i>ing</i> to the words in Monday's
lesson; the suffix <i>able</i> to the words for Tuesday and Wednesday; the
suffixes <i>some</i> and <i>ous</i> to the words for Thursday; the suffixes
<i>ly</i> or <i>ness</i> to the words for Friday and Saturday.
</p>


<p><b>Monday</b></p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 14</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>You remember our definition of a word; a word is the sign of an
idea. In our lessons we have been studying the different kinds of words
which we use in the expression of our complete thoughts. Probably
the first step in the development of language was to name the objects
about us. Then the next logical step would be to invent words which
would tell what these objects did. So we have our nouns, which are
the names of things; our verbs, which tell what these things do; and
in these we have the foundation for spoken and written speech. We
soon found, however, that the constant repetition of a name was tiresome
and annoying, so we invented words which we could use in place of these
nouns; and we have pronouns.
</p>

<p>All of the things about us possess certain qualities and our next great
need was for words to describe these qualities; so we have adjectives.
Each adjective is a sign of an idea. It adds its part to the expression
of our complete thought. So we find that each part of speech comes
logically in its place to fill a certain need. Without any one of them,
we would be crippled in our power of expression. Each different word
is the sign of an idea and the combination of these ideas as represented
by the various signs gives us the complete expression of our thought.
</p>

<p>So primitive man in the development of written speech had signs
to express the various things about him. Naturally his first sign was a
picture, as nearly as he could draw it, of the object itself. If he wanted
to tell you about a tree he drew a picture of the tree; the picture of a
man represented a man, and so on. You will notice among children that
this is the first development in their endeavor to express their thoughts
in writing. They draw pictures. The average small child cannot understand
why you read those strange marks on the page. They want you
to read the pictures. To their mind that is the only way to communicate
ideas.
</p>

<p>These early forefathers of ours grew to be very adept at this picture
writing. We have examples of this among the Indians of our own
country. There is a picture on the face of a big rock on the shores of
Lake Superior which records an expedition across the lake led by a
noted Indian chief. Canoes are shown in the picture with the crew
denoted by a series of upright strokes and there is a picture of the chief
on horseback. You or I would have great difficulty in reading this
picture writing, but an Indian could read it right off just as we would
read a written page. Aids to memory such as knotted strings and tally
sticks were the first step toward written speech. This picture writing
was the second step toward the development of written speech.
</p>

<p>We owe a great deal to the work which these primitive ancestors of
ours accomplished. It took them years and years to develop through these
different stages and our rapid development of the last few centuries
<a class="pagenum" id="page_139" title="pg 139"></a>
has only been made possible because of this slow and patient building
of the foundation. An understanding of this helps us to appreciate
the place we occupy in this great struggle of the ages. The power of
written speech opens up to us such tremendous possibilities. Let us make
the most of them, that we too may hand on worth while things to those
who follow us.

<h3>CLASSES OF ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_242">242.</b> Adjectives, like nouns and pronouns, are divided into classes.
Adjectives are divided into two main classes, <i>qualifying</i> and
<i>limiting</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_243">243</b>. An adjective which qualifies a noun is one which names some
quality which is possessed by the word which it modifies. When we
say, <i>Trees grow</i>, we are making a general statement; that is, we are saying
something that is true of any kind of trees. We have not described
any particular tree. But when we say, <i>The tall trees grow</i>, <i>The old trees
grow</i>, <i>The young trees grow</i>, the words <i>tall</i>, <i>old</i>
and <i>young</i> describe certain
qualities of the trees, which separate them into classes. So these
adjectives are <i>qualifying adjectives</i>.
</p>

<p>An adjective qualifies a noun when it attributes some quality to
the noun, as, <i>The brave man</i>, <i>The sweet apple</i>, <i>The
pretty girl</i>, <i>The large house</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_244">244.</b> But if we say, <i>this tree</i>, <i>that tree</i>, <i>some
trees</i>, <i>many trees</i>, <i>three
trees</i>, or <i>four trees</i>, we are not giving any quality of the
tree, but are pointing out a particular tree or trees and limiting the word to the
ones pointed out. So such adjectives as <i>the</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>some</i>, <i>many</i>, <i>three</i> and
<i>four</i> are limiting adjectives. An adjective limits a noun when it
restricts or limits its meaning as to quantity or number.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_245">245.</b> So adjectives are divided into two classes,
<i>qualifying</i> adjectives and <i>limiting</i> adjectives.
</p>

<p><b>Words that limit or qualify other words are called</b>
<i>modifiers</i> <b>because
they modify or affect the meaning of the words to which they
are added.</b> So adjectives are modifiers of the nouns and pronouns
to which they are added because they modify or qualify or limit the
meaning of the noun or pronoun.
</p>

<p>The limiting adjectives answer the questions <i>which</i> and <i>how many</i>.
The qualifying adjectives answer the questions <i>which</i> and <i>what kind</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_246">246.</b> <b>A qualifying adjective is an adjective which describes the
noun it modifies by attributing to it some quality.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A limiting adjective is an adjective which merely shows which
one or how many, without describing the noun it modifies.</b>
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_140" title="pg 140"></a>
HOW TO DISCOVER AN ADJECTIVE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_247">247.</b> Sometimes the noun may have several adjectives qualifying
or modifying it; as,</p>

<ul>
<li>The beautiful, old elm tree shades the lawn.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>old</i> and <i>elm</i>, all modify
<i>tree</i>, telling something of the
qualities or pointing out which tree we are speaking of. You can discover
an adjective in a sentence by asking the questions, <i>which</i>, <i>what
kind</i>, or <i>how many</i>; and the words that answer these questions will be
the adjectives in the sentence. For example in this sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Those three immense factories employ thousands of men.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Factories</i> is the noun, subject of the sentence. <i>Which</i>
factory is indicated by the adjective <i>those</i>. <i>How many</i> factories is
indicated by the adjective <i>three</i>. <i>What kind</i> of factories is indicated
by the adjective <i>immense</i>. So we have three adjectives answering the three
questions, <i>which</i>, <i>what kind</i> and <i>how many</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the adjectives are printed in <i>italics</i>.
Study them carefully and determine which are qualifying and which are
limiting adjectives. Note that the possessive nouns and possessive pronouns
are <i>not</i> adjectives. <i>Its</i> in the phrases <i>its cruel fangs</i> and <i>its savage
claws</i>, is a possessive pronoun, third person singular. In the last sentence
<i>beggar's</i>, <i>miser's</i>, and <i>Ingersoll's</i>, are nouns in the possessive form.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>This terrible</i> war in Europe is slaughtering <i>the</i> working-class.</li>

<li><i>Gaunt</i> famine follows war.</li>

<li>A <i>docile</i>, <i>meek</i>, <i>humble</i>, working-class makes war
<i>possible</i>.</li>

<li><i>The shrieking</i> shell snarls like a <i>living</i> thing; like
<i>some wild</i> beast
in <i>ferocious</i> glee it thrusts its <i>cruel</i> fangs in earth and
rock and rends
<i>living</i> flesh with its <i>savage</i> claws.</li>

<li>Its <i>fetid</i> breath of <i>poison</i> powder scorches in <i>the
autumn</i> winds.</li>

<li><i>Shattered</i> bones, <i>torn</i> flesh and <i>flowing</i> blood were
mingled on <i>the</i>
battlefield with <i>broken</i> swords and <i>split</i> rifles.</li>

<li><i>The best modern</i> rifles will force <i>a</i> bullet through <i>five
human</i> bodies
at <i>a</i> range of <i>twelve hundred</i> feet.</li>

<li><i>The pitiful</i> dead, <i>slain</i> in war, sleep under <i>the
solemn</i> pines, <i>the
sad</i> hemlock, <i>the tearful</i> willow and <i>the embracing</i>
vines.</li>

<li>A world without <i>the</i> beggar's <i>outstretched</i> palm, <i>the</i>
miser's <i>heartless</i>
<i>stony</i> stare, <i>the piteous</i> wail of want, <i>the livid</i>
lips of lies, <i>the cruel</i> eyes
of scorn, was Ingersoll's vision of <i>the</i> future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>QUALIFYING ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_248">248.</b> Qualifying adjectives are also called <i>descriptive</i> adjectives because
they describe the noun. They answer the questions <i>which</i> and <i>what kind</i>.
</p>

<p>You remember we found in the beginning of our study of English,
that words were grouped into classes according to the work which they
do in the sentence, not according to the form of the word itself. For
<a class="pagenum" id="page_141" title="pg 141"></a>
instance, we have already found that some words, without changing
their form, may be used either as a noun or as a verb. Take the word
<i>oil</i>, for instance. I may say, <i>I oil the engine</i>. Here I have used the word
<i>oil</i> as a verb telling what I do. But I may say, <i>The oil is gone</i>. Here I
have used the word <i>oil</i> as a noun, subject of the sentence. The part of
speech to which a word belongs in the English language, always depends
upon the work which it does in the sentence.
</p>

<p><b>1.</b> So we have nouns which are used as descriptive adjectives,
for example the word <i>oil</i>, which we have found we can use either as a
noun or a verb, may also be used as an adjective. For example; I
may say, <i>the oil tank</i>. Here I have used the word <i>oil</i> as a descriptive
adjective modifying the word <i>tank</i>. So also we may say, <i>the oak tree</i>,
<i>the stone curb</i>, <i>the earth wall</i>. In these expressions
<i>oak</i>, <i>stone</i> and <i>earth</i> are nouns used as descriptive adjectives.
</p>

<p><b>2.</b> We have descriptive adjectives derived from proper nouns, as
French, English, American. These are called proper adjectives; and
since all proper nouns must begin with a capital letter, these proper
adjectives, also, should always begin with a capital letter.
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> We have also descriptive adjectives derived from verbs as
<i>active</i>, <i>talkative</i>, <i>movable</i>, <i>desirable</i>,
derived by the addition of suffixes
to the verbs <i>act</i>, <i>talk</i>, <i>move</i> and <i>desire</i>.
</p>

<h3>LIMITING ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_249">249.</b> Limiting adjectives are also divided into classes, the
<i>numerals</i>, the <i>demonstratives</i> and the <i>articles</i>.</p>


<h4>Numeral Adjectives</h4>

<p><b id="sec_250">250.</b> Numeral adjectives are those which limit nouns as to number
or order. They are such adjectives as <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>,
<i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, etc., and
<i>first</i>, <i>second</i> and <i>third</i>, etc., as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Three</i> men applied for work.</li>
<li>The train ran at the rate of <i>forty</i> miles an hour.</li>
<li>There have always been <i>two</i> classes in the world.</li>
<li>The <i>first</i> martyr to anti-militarism was Jaures.</li>
<li>The <i>eighteenth</i> day of March is the anniversary of the Paris Commune.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the adjectives <i>three</i>, <i>forty</i>,
<i>two</i>, <i>first</i> and
<i>eighteenth</i> are all numeral adjectives. They limit the nouns which
they modify as to number or order.
</p>

<p><b>Adjectives that limit nouns as to number or order are called
numeral adjectives. Numeral adjectives answer the question how
many or in what order.</b>
</p>

<h4>Demonstratives</h4>

<p><b id="sec_251">251.</b> We have also a class of adjectives which are used to point
out some particular person or thing. These are called <i>demonstrative</i>
adjectives. Demonstrate means literally <i>to point out</i>. So these adjectives
<a class="pagenum" id="page_142" title="pg 142"></a>
point out from a number of things, one particular thing to our
attention. These demonstrative adjectives are <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>those</i>, <i>these</i>, <i>yonder</i>, <i>former</i>, <i>latter</i> and <i>same</i>.
</p>

<p><i>These</i> and <i>those</i> are the plural forms of <i>this</i> and
<i>that</i>. <i>This</i> and
<i>these</i> are used to point out things near at hand. <i>That</i> and
<i>those</i> are used
to point out things more distant, as <i>This is my book</i>. <i>These
are my papers</i>, meaning <i>this book</i> or <i>these papers</i>, close to
me. By, <i>That is my
pencil</i> and <i>Those are my letters</i>, I mean <i>that pencil</i>,
and <i>those letters</i>,
which are farther away from me.
</p>

<p><i>Former</i> and <i>latter</i> are used to show which of two things
already mentioned is referred to, and to point out things in point of time, not
of place. For example, we may say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We no longer observe the <i>former</i> customs, but rather prefer the
<i>latter</i>.</li>

<li>He did not like his <i>former</i> job but this <i>latter</i> job pleases
him.</li>
</ul>

<p>You understand from this that we have been discussing and describing
two kinds of work, and that the first in point of time was unpleasant
and the second pleasant.
</p>

<p>The demonstrative adjective <i>same</i> refers to something of which
we have just spoken, as for example, <i>He has gone to work, I must do
the same thing</i>. These demonstrative adjectives answer the question
which, so when you wish to discover a demonstrative in a sentence, ask
the question <i>which</i>, and the answer will be the demonstrative
adjective.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<ol>
<li><i>This</i> study is very interesting.</li>
<li><i>These</i> comrades will stand by us.</li>
<li><i>That</i> solution will never deceive the people.</li>
<li><i>Those</i> books have opened our eyes.</li>
<li><i>Yonder</i> battle appals the world.</li>
<li><i>Former</i> investigations have had no results.</li>
<li><i>This latter</i> decision has reversed the <i>former</i>.</li>
<li>The class struggle has persisted through the centuries; we are
engaged in the <i>same</i> struggle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sentences of your own containing these demonstrative adjectives.</p>


<h3>ARTICLES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_252">252.</b> We have three adjectives which are used so commonly that
we have put them in a class by themselves. These three little words
are <i>a</i>, <i>an</i> and <i>the</i>, and we call them articles. The
word <i>article</i> literally
means a little joint or limb, and these three little words are so
closely connected with the nouns with which they are used that they seem to
be a part or joint or limb of the noun itself, and so we have called
them articles.
</p>

<p><i>A</i> and <i>an</i> are called the <i>indefinite</i> articles because
they point out an
object in a very indefinite manner. <i>The</i> is called the
<i>definite</i> article for
it points out in a more definite way.
</p>

<p>We use <i>a</i> before words beginning with a consonant sound, as <i>a
man</i>, <i>a tree</i>, <i>a book</i>; and we use <i>an</i> before words
beginning with a vowel
sound, as <i>an apple</i>, <i>an editor</i>, <i>an orange</i>, <i>an
heir</i>. In <i>heir</i> the <i>h</i> is silent,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_143" title="pg 143"></a>
and we say <i>an</i> because the word begins with a vowel sound.
<i>A</i> is used before words beginning with <i>u</i> because long <i>u</i> is equivalent
in sound to a consonant, for the blending of the sounds of which long <i>u</i> is
composed produces the initial sound of <i>y</i>, which is a consonant sound. For
example, we say, <i>a university</i>, <i>a useful work</i>, etc., and not <i>an
university</i>. Before words beginning with short <i>u</i>, use <i>an</i>, as, <i>an
upstart</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>In deciding whether to use <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>, watch the initial
<i>sound</i> of the word, not the initial <i>letter</i>. If it is a vowel sound use
<i>an</i>, if a consonant sound, use <i>a</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Underscore the correct article in the following sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bring me an&mdash;a apple.</li>
<li>He is a&mdash;an able orator.</li>
<li>A&mdash;an heir was born to the German King.</li>
<li>He built a&mdash;an house for his family.</li>
<li>He is an&mdash;a honest man.</li>
<li>He is a&mdash;an undertaker.</li>
<li>I had to take a&mdash;an upper berth.</li>
<li>He joined a&mdash;an union.</li>
<li>It is a&mdash;an unique book.</li>
<li>He is a&mdash;an unruly member of society.</li>
<li>He told a&mdash;an untruth.</li>
<li>He wears a&mdash;an uniform.</li>
<li>It is a&mdash;an honor to be chosen.</li>
</ol>

<p><b id="sec_253">253.</b> When a singular noun is modified by several adjectives, only
one of the articles <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> must be used if the noun
denotes but <i>one</i>
object; but if the noun denotes more than one object the article must
be repeated before each noun. For example, I say, <i>A red, white and
blue flag</i>. You know I mean but one flag, containing the three
colors, red, white and blue. But if I say, <i>A red, a white and a blue
flag</i>, you know I mean three flags, one red, one white, and one blue.
</p>

<p>Note the use of the article in the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He wears a black and white suit.</li>
<li>He wears a black and a white suit.</li>
<li>He sold a red and white cow.</li>
<li>He sold a red and a white cow.</li>
<li>He bought a gas and coal stove.</li>
<li>He bought a gas and a coal stove.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first sentences in each of the above series refers to only one
object. The second sentences all refer to two objects.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_254">254.</b> There are some rules concerning the article <i>the</i> that
it is well to know because we do not always say what we wish to say, if we
do not observe these rules or customs of speech. For example, I say,
<i>The editor and <span class="corr" title="publiher">publisher</span> of this book is
unknown</i>. I have used the article
<i>the</i> but once, and I mean that the editor and publisher is one
person. But I may say, <i>The editor and the publisher of this book are well
known</i>.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_144" title="pg 144"></a>
In this sentence I have used the article <i>the</i> twice, <i>the</i>
editor and <i>the</i>
publisher, and I mean that the editor and the publisher are two
different persons.
</p>

<p>So when two or more nouns following each other denote the same
person or thing, the article is not repeated, but when the nouns denote
different persons or things, the article must be repeated before each
noun. Be sure to use the proper form of the verb.
</p>

<p>Note the following sentences and underscore the proper verb to
complete the meaning:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The secretary and treasurer were&mdash;was here.</li>
<li>The secretary and the treasurer were&mdash;was elected.</li>
<li>The singer and artist were&mdash;was with me.</li>
<li>The singer and the artist were&mdash;was on the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes we have two things so closely associated in use that
they may be considered as forming a single idea, so that we may use the
article before the first one only. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The pen and ink is gone.</li>
<li>He bought a horse and buggy.</li>
<li>The bread and butter is on the plate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>INTERROGATIVE ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_255">255.</b> You remember we found in the study of pronouns that we
have interrogative pronouns which we use in asking questions when we
do not know the name of the object concerning which we are asking.
We also have adjectives which we use in asking questions when we
do not know the number or quality of the object concerning which we
are asking. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Which</i> book did you enjoy most?</li>
<li><i>What</i> work are you doing now?</li>
<li><i>What</i> machine did you order?</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Which</i> and <i>what</i> are the interrogative adjectives in these
sentences.
</p>

<p><b>Interrogative adjectives are adjectives used in asking questions.</b></p>


<h3>INDEFINITES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_256">256.</b> We have one more class of adjectives called indefinites.</p>

<p><b>An indefinite adjective is one that does not denote any particular
person or thing.</b>
</p>

<p>All such adjectives as <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>either</i>,
<i>neither</i>, <i>some</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>many</i>,
<i>much</i>, <i>few</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>both</i>, <i>no</i>,
<i>none</i>, <i>several</i> and <i>certain</i> are indefinite
adjectives. We use them when we are not speaking of any particular person
or thing, but are speaking in a broad, general sense and in an
indefinite manner.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_257">257.</b> The interrogative adjectives are sometimes used in this
indefinite way. They are sometimes used to modify nouns when a direct
question is not asked, and they are then used, not as interrogative
adjectives, but as indefinite adjectives. For example:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_145" title="pg 145"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>He did not know which party to join.</li>
<li>I have not learned what time he will go.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> are not used to ask
questions, but are used to describe an unknown object.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>All the words in italics are adjectives. Decide to which class each
adjective belongs.</p>

<p>Note in this exercise the compound words used as adjectives, as:
<i>earth-born</i>, <i>self-made</i>, <i>new-lit</i>,
<i>blood-rusted</i>. Look up the meaning of
these adjectives and see if you can use other adjectives in their places
and keep the same meaning. Note the use of <i>fellest</i>.
</p>

<div class="poem xwide">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Slavery, <i>the earth-born</i> Cyclops, <i>fellest</i> of <i>the
giant</i> brood,</p>
<p>Sons of <i>brutish</i> Force and Darkness, who have drenched <i>the</i>
earth with blood,</p>
<p><i>Famished</i> in his <i>self-made</i> desert, <i>blinded</i> by our
<i>purer</i> day,</p>
<p>Gropes in yet <i>unblasted</i> regions for his <i>miserable</i>
prey;&mdash;</p>
<p>Shall we guide his <i>gory</i> fingers where our <i>helpless</i>
children play?</p>
<p>They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our sires,</p>
<p><i>Smothering</i> in their <i>holy</i> ashes Freedom's <i>new-lit</i>
altar-fires;</p>
<p>Shall we make their creed our jailer? Shall we, in our haste to slay,</p>
<p>From the tombs of <i>the old</i> prophets steal <i>the funeral</i> lamps
away</p>
<p>To light up <i>the</i> martyr-fagots round <i>the</i> prophets of
to-day?</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>New</i> occasions teach <i>new</i> duties; Time makes <i>ancient</i>
good, <i>uncouth</i>;</p>
<p>They must upward still, and onward, who would keep <i>abreast</i> of

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>The following is from Oscar Wilde's story of <i>The Young King</i>.
Oscar Wilde was a master of English, and if you have the opportunity,
read all of this beautiful story and watch his use of adjectives. Mark
the adjectives in this excerpt and use them in sentences of your own.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as the young King slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his
dream. He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the
whirr and clatter of many looms. The meager daylight peered in through
the grated windows and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers, bending
over their cases. Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the
huge crossbeams. As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the
heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and
pressed the threads together. Their faces were pinched with famine, and their
thin hands shook and trembled. Some haggard women were seated at a table,
sewing. A horrible odor filled the place. The air was foul and heavy,
and the walls dripped and streamed with damp.</p>

<p>The young King went over to one of the weavers and stood by him and
watched him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_146" title="pg 146"></a>
And the weaver looked at him angrily and said, "Why art thou watching
me? Art thou a spy set on us by our master?"</p>

<p>"Who is thy master?" asked the young King.</p>

<p>"Our master!" cried the weaver, bitterly. "He is a man like myself.
Indeed, there is but this difference between us&mdash;that he wears fine clothes
while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he suffers not a
little from overfeeding."</p>

<p>"The land is free," said the young King, "and thou art no man's slave."</p>

<p>"In war," answered the weaver, "the strong make slaves of the weak, and
in peace the rich make slaves of the poor. We must work to live, and
they give us such mean wages that we die. We toil for them all day long, and
they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their
time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil. We tread out the
grapes, another drinks the wine. We sow the corn, and our own board is empty.
We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men
call us free."</p>

<p>"Is it so with all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is so with all," answered the weaver, "with the young as well as
with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little
children as well as with those who are stricken in years. The merchants grind us
down, and we must needs do their bidding. The priest rides by and tells his
beads, and no man has care of us. Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with
her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her.
Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night. But what are
these things to thee? Thou art not one of us. Thy face is too happy."
And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle across the loom, and the
young King saw that it was threaded with a thread of gold.</p>

<p>And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, "What
robe is this that thou art weaving?"</p>

<p>"It is the robe for the coronation of the young King," he answered;
"What is that to thee?"</p>

<p>And the young King gave a loud cry and woke and lo! he was in his own
chamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-colored moon
hanging in the dusky air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 14</h2>

<p>You remember in the formation of plurals, we learned that words
ending in <i>y</i> change <i>y</i> to <i>i</i> when <i>es</i> is added;
as, <i>lady, ladies</i>; <i>baby, babies</i>;
<i>dry, dries</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>There are several rules concerning words ending in <i>y</i>, knowledge
of which will aid us greatly in spelling.
</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <b>Words ending in</b> <i>ie</i> <b>change the</b> <i>ie</i>
<b>to</b> <i>y</i> <b>before</b> <i>ing</i> <b>to prevent
a confusing number of vowels.</b> For example, <i>die, dying</i>;
<i>lie, lying</i>; <i>tie,
tying</i>.
</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <b>Words of more than one syllable ending in</b> <i>y</i>
<b>preceded by
a consonant, change</b> <i>y</i> <b>into</b> <i>i</i> <b>before all
suffixes except those beginning
with</b> <i>i</i>. For example:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_147" title="pg 147"></a></p>

<table>
<tr><td>happy,</td>       <td>happily,</td>      <td>happiness;</td></tr>
<tr><td>witty,</td>       <td>wittier,</td>      <td>wittiest;</td></tr>
<tr><td>satisfy,</td>     <td>satisfied,</td>    <td>satisfying;</td></tr>
<tr><td>envy,</td>        <td>enviable,</td>     <td>envying;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This exception is made for suffixes beginning with <i>i</i>, the most
common of which is <i>ing</i>, to avoid having a confusing number of
<i>i's</i>.
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>Most words ending in</b> <i>y</i> <b>preceded by a vowel
retain the</b> <i>y</i>
<b>before a suffix.</b>  For example:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>destroy,</td>     <td>destroyer,</td>     <td>destroying,</td></tr>
<tr><td>buy,</td>         <td>buyer,</td>         <td>buying,</td></tr>
<tr><td>essay,</td>       <td>essayed,</td>       <td>essayist.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following words are exception to this rule:</p>

<ul>
<li>laid,</li>
<li>paid,</li>
<li>said,</li>
<li>daily,</li>
<li>staid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make as many words as you can out of the words given in this
week's spelling lesson by adding one or more of the following suffixes:
<i>er</i>, <i>est</i>, <i>ed</i>, <i>es</i>, <i>ing</i>, <i>ly</i>,
<i>ness</i>, <i>ful</i>, <i>ment</i>, <i>al</i>.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 15</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this week's lesson we are finishing the study of adjectives, which
adds another part of speech to those which we have studied. We can
see in the study of each additional part of speech how each part has
its place in the expression of our ideas. We could not express ourselves
fully if we lacked any of these parts of speech. Each one is not an
arbitrary addition to our language but has come to us out of the need
for it. We see that there are no arbitrary rules but in language, as in
all things else, growing needs have developed more efficient tools. With
these have grown up certain rules of action so we can have a common
usage and system in our use of these tools. It has taken years of effort
to accomplish this. The changes have been slow and gradual, and this
language which we are studying is the finished product.
</p>

<p>This slow development in the use of language, even in our own
lives, makes us realize how many thousands of years it must have taken
our primitive ancestors to reach a point where they could use the phonetic
alphabet. We have found that at first they used simple aids to memory,
as knotted strings and tally sticks. Then they began to draw pictures
of things about them and so were able to communicate with one
another by means of these pictures. When a man was going away from
his cave and wanted to leave word for those who might come, telling
them where he had gone and how soon he would return, he drew a picture
of a man over the entrance with the arm extended in the direction
in which he had gone. Then he drew another picture of a man in a
sleeping position and also one of a man with both hands extended in
the gesture which indicated many. These two pictures showed that he
would be away over many nights. In some such rude manner as this,
they were able to communicate with one another.
</p>

<p>But man soon began to <i>think</i>, and he needed to express ideas concerning
things of which he could not draw pictures. He could draw a
picture of the sun, but how could he indicate light? How could he indicate
the different professions in which men engaged, such as the
farmer and priest, etc.?
</p>

<p>He was forced to invent symbols or signs to express these ideas,
so his writing was no longer a picture of some object, but he added to
it symbols of abstract ideas. A circle which stood for the sun written
with the crescent which stood for the moon, indicated light. The bee
became a symbol of industry. An ostrich feather was a symbol of justice,
because these feathers were supposed to be of equal length. A
picture of a woman stood simply for a woman, but a picture of two
women stood for strife, and three women stood for intrigue. These
old ancestors of ours became wise quite early concerning some things.
The symbol for a priest in the early Egyptian picture writing was a
jackal. Perhaps not because he "devoured widows' houses," but because
<a class="pagenum" id="page_149" title="pg 149"></a>
the jackal was a very watchful animal. The symbol for mother
was a vulture because that bird was believed to nourish its young with

<p>The development of language has been a marvelous growth and a
wonderful heritage has come to us. Let us never be satisfied until we
have a mastery of our language and find a way to express the ideas that

<h3>ADJECTIVES AND PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_258">258.</b> From our study of the adjective, we know that it is a word
used with a noun to qualify or limit its meaning. But a great many times
we find these adjectives used without the noun which they modify.
As, for example, I may say, <i>This is mine</i>, and the adjective
<i>this</i> is used
alone without the noun which it modifies, and you are able to tell only
by what I have been saying or by some action of mine to what I am
referring when I say <i>this</i>.
</p>

<p>When adjectives are used in this manner, they are used like pronouns&mdash;in
place of a noun. So sometimes we find an adjective used
with a noun, and sometimes used as a pronoun, in place of a noun; and
since we name our parts of speech by the work which they do in the
sentence, an adjective used in this way is not an adjective, but a
pronoun
or word used in place of a noun.
</p>

<p>So these words are pronouns when they stand alone to represent
things&mdash;when they are used in place of a noun. They are adjectives
when they are used <i>with</i> a noun to limit or qualify the noun. For
example, I may say, <i>This tree is an elm, but that tree is an oak</i>.
<i>This</i> and <i>that</i> in this sentence are adjectives used to modify the noun
<i>tree</i>. But I may say, <i>This is an oak and that is an elm</i>, and in this
sentence <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> are used without a noun, they are used as pronouns.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_259">259.</b> Our being able to name every part of speech is not nearly so
important as our being able to understand the functions of the different
parts of speech and being able to use them correctly. But still it is
well for us to be able to take a sentence and point out its different
parts and tell what each part is and the function which it serves in the
sentence. So sometimes in doing this we may find it difficult to tell whether
certain words are adjectives or pronouns. We can distinguish between
adjectives and pronouns by this rule:
</p>

<p>When you cannot supply the noun which the adjective modifies,
from the <i>same</i> sentence, then the word which takes the place of
the noun is a pronoun, but if you can supply the omitted noun from the same
sentence, then the word is used as an adjective. Thus, we do not say
that the noun is understood unless it has already been used in the same
sentence and is omitted to avoid repetition. We make each sentence
a law unto itself and classify each word in the sentence according to
what it does in its own sentence.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_150" title="pg 150"></a>
So if a noun does not occur in the same sentence with the word
about which we are in doubt as to whether it is a pronoun or adjective,
it is a pronoun or word used in place of a noun. For example, in the
sentence, <i>This book is good but that is better</i>; <i>book</i> is
understood after the word <i>that</i> and left out to avoid tiresome repetition of the
word <i>book</i>. Therefore <i>that</i> is an adjective in this sentence. But if I say,
<i>This is good, but that is better</i>; there is no noun understood, for there is
no noun in the sentence which we can supply with <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>.
Therefore in this sentence <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> are pronouns, used in place of the
noun. And since <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, when used as adjectives, are called
demonstrative adjectives; therefore when <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, <i>these</i> and
<i>those</i>, and similar words, are used as pronouns they are called demonstrative pronouns.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_260">260.</b> Be careful not to confuse the possessive pronouns with
adjectives. Possessive pronouns modify the nouns with which they are used,
but they are not adjectives, they are possessive pronouns. <i>My</i>,
<i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>your</i> and <i>their</i> are all
possessive pronouns, not adjectives.
Also be careful not to confuse nouns in the possessive form with adjectives.
</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVES AS NOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_261">261.</b> Sometimes you will find words, which we are accustomed to
look upon as adjectives, used alone in the sentence without a noun
which they modify. For example, we say, <i>The strong enslave the weak</i>.
Here we have used the adjectives <i>strong</i> and <i>weak</i> without any accompanying
noun. In sentences like this, these adjectives, being used as
nouns, are classed as nouns. Remember, in your analysis of a sentence,
that you name every word according to the work which it does in that
sentence, so while these adjectives are doing the work of nouns, we will
consider them as nouns.
</p>

<p>These words are not used in the same manner in which demonstrative
adjectives are used as pronouns. There is no noun omitted which
might be inserted, but these adjectives are used rather to name a class.
As, for example; when we say, <i>The strong</i>, <i>The weak</i>, we mean all those
who are strong and all those who are weak, considered as a class. You
will find adjectives used in this way quite often in your reading, and you
will find that you use this construction very often in your ordinary
speech. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The rich look down upon the poor.</li>
<li>The wise instruct the ignorant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many examples will occur to you. Remember these adjectives are
nouns when they do the work of nouns.
</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVES WITH PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_262">262.</b> Since pronouns are used in place of nouns, they may have
modifiers, also, just as nouns do. So you will often find adjectives
used to modify pronouns. As, for example; <i>He, tired, weak
and ill, was unable to hold his position</i>. Here, <i>tired</i>, <i>weak</i> and
<i>ill</i> are adjectives modifying the pronoun <i>he</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_151" title="pg 151"></a>
<b id="sec_263">263.</b> We often find a participle used as an adjective with a
pronoun. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>She, having finished her work, went home.</li>
<li>They, having completed the organization, left the city.</li>
<li>He, having been defeated, became discouraged.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, the participles, <i>having finished</i>, <i>having
completed</i>, and <i>having been defeated</i>, are used as adjectives to modify the
pronouns <i>she</i>, <i>they</i> and <i>he</i>.
</p>

<h3>COMPARISON</h3>

<p><b id="sec_264">264.</b> We have found that adjectives are a very important part of
our speech for without them we could not describe the various objects
about us and make known to others our ideas concerning their various
qualities. But with the addition of these helpful words we can describe
very fully the qualities of the things with which we come into contact.
We soon find, however, that there are varying degrees of these
qualities. Some objects possess them in slight degree, some more fully and some in
the highest degree. So we must have some way of expressing these
varying degrees in the use of our adjectives.
</p>

<p>This brings us to the study of comparison of adjectives. Suppose
I say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>That orange is sweet, the one yonder is sweeter, but this one is
sweetest.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have used the adjective <i>sweet</i> expressing a quality possessed by
oranges in three different forms, <i>sweet</i>, <i>sweeter</i> and
<i>sweetest</i>. This is the change in the form of adjectives to show different degrees of
quality. This change is called comparison, because we use it when we compare
one thing with another in respect to some quality which they possess,
but possess in different degrees.
</p>

<p>The form of the adjective which expresses a simple quality, as
<i>sweet</i>, is called the positive degree. That which expresses a
quality in a greater degree, as <i>sweeter</i>, is called the comparative degree.
That which expresses a quality in the greatest degree, as <i>sweetest</i>, is
called the superlative degree.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_265">265.</b> <b>Comparison is the change of form of an adjective to
denote different degrees of quality.</b>
</p>

<p><b>There are three degrees of comparison, positive, comparative
and superlative.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The positive degree of an adjective denotes simple quality.</b></p>

<p><b>The comparative degree denotes a higher degree of a quality.</b></p>

<p><b>The superlative degree denotes the highest degree of a quality.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_266">266.</b> Most adjectives of one syllable and many adjectives of two
syllables regularly add <i>er</i> to the positive to form the
comparative degree, and <i>est</i> to the positive to form the superlative degree, as:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_152" title="pg 152"></a></p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>      <th class="sub">Comparative</th>      <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>sweet</td>          <td>sweeter</td>         <td>sweetest</td></tr>
<tr><td>cold</td>           <td>colder</td>          <td>coldest</td></tr>
<tr><td>soft</td>           <td>softer</td>          <td>softest</td></tr>
<tr><td>brave</td>          <td>braver</td>          <td>bravest</td></tr>
<tr><td>clear</td>          <td>clearer</td>         <td>clearest</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_267">267.</b> Adjectives ending in <i>y</i> change <i>y</i> to <i>i</i>
and add <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> to
form the comparative and superlative degree, as:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>      <th class="sub">Comparative</th>      <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>busy</td>           <td>busier</td>           <td>busiest</td></tr>
<tr><td>lazy</td>           <td>lazier</td>           <td>laziest</td></tr>
<tr><td>sly</td>            <td>slier</td>            <td>sliest</td></tr>
<tr><td>witty</td>          <td>wittier</td>          <td>wittiest</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_268">268.</b>  Many adjectives cannot be compared by this change in the
word itself, since the addition of <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> would make
awkward or ill-sounding
words. Hence we must employ another method to form the
comparison of this sort of words. To say, <i>beautiful</i>,
<i>beautifuller</i>, <i>beautifullest</i>,
is awkward and does not sound well. So we say <i>beautiful</i>,
<i>more beautiful</i>, <i>most beautiful</i>.
</p>

<p>Many adjectives form the comparative and superlative degree by
using <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> with the simple form of the adjective,
as:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>       <th class="sub">Comparative</th>        <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>beautiful</td>      <td>more beautiful</td>      <td>most beautiful</td></tr>
<tr><td>thankful</td>       <td>more thankful</td>       <td>most thankful</td></tr>
<tr><td>sensitive</td>      <td>more sensitive</td>      <td>most sensitive</td></tr>
<tr><td>wonderful</td>      <td>more wonderful</td>      <td>most wonderful</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_269">269.</b> Adjectives of two syllables, to which <i>er</i> and
<i>est</i> are added to form the comparison, are chiefly those ending in <i>y</i> or
<i>le</i>, such as:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>     <th class="sub">Comparative</th>     <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>happy</td>          <td>happier</td>         <td>happiest</td></tr>
<tr><td>noble</td>          <td>nobler</td>          <td>noblest</td></tr>
<tr><td>steady</td>         <td>steadier</td>        <td>steadiest</td></tr>
<tr><td>feeble</td>         <td>feebler</td>         <td>feeblest</td></tr>
<tr><td>able</td>           <td>abler</td>           <td>ablest</td></tr>
<tr><td>witty</td>          <td>wittier</td>         <td>wittiest</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_270">270.</b> Some adjectives, few in number, but which we use very often,
are irregular in their comparison. The most important of these are as
follows: (It would be well to memorize these.)
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_153" title="pg 153"></a></p>

<h3>DESCENDING COMPARISON</h3>

<p><b id="sec_271">271.</b> The change in form of adjectives in the positive, comparative
and superlative shows that one object has more of a quality than others
with which it is compared. But we also wish at times to express the
fact that one object has less of the quality than is possessed by others
with which it is compared; so we have what we may call the descending
comparison, by means of phrases formed by using <i>less</i> and
<i>least</i> instead
of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>. Using <i>less</i> with the positive
degree means a degree
less than the positive, while using <i>least</i> expresses the lowest
degree. For example:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="3">Descending Comparison</th></tr>

<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>        <th class="sub">Comparative</th>          <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>beautiful</td>       <td>less beautiful</td>       <td>least beautiful</td></tr>
<tr><td>intelligent</td>     <td>less intelligent</td>     <td>least intelligent</td></tr>
<tr><td>sensitive</td>       <td>less sensitive</td>       <td>least sensitive</td></tr>
<tr><td>thankful</td>        <td>less thankful</td>        <td>least thankful</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>PARTICIPLES AS ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_272">272.</b> You remember, when we studied the participle, that we found
it was called a participle because it partook of the nature of two or
more parts of speech. For example; in the sentence, <i>The singing of
the birds greeted us</i>; <i>singing</i> is a participle derived from
the verb <i>sing</i>,
and is used as a noun, the subject of the verb <i>greeted</i>.
</p>

<p>But participles are used not only as nouns; they may also be used
as adjectives. For example; we may say, <i>The singing birds greeted
us</i>. Here the participle <i>singing</i> describes the birds, telling what
kind of birds greeted us, and is used as an adjective modifying the noun
<i>birds</i>.
</p>

<p>You will recall that we found there were two forms of the participle,
the present participle and the past participle. The present participle
is formed by adding <i>ing</i> to the root form of the verb; and the
past participle in regular verbs is formed by adding <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i> to the root
form, and in irregular verbs by a change in the verb form itself. These two simple
forms of participles are often used as adjectives.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_154" title="pg 154"></a>
<b id="sec_273">273.</b> The present participle is almost always active; that is, it
refers to the actor. As, for example; <i>Vessels, carrying soldiers, are
constantly arriving</i>. Here the present participle <i>carrying</i>
describes the noun <i>vessels</i>, and yet retains its function as a verb and has an
object, <i>soldiers</i>. So it partakes of two parts of speech, the verb and the
adjective.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_274">274.</b> The past participle, when used alone, is almost always
passive, for it refers not to the actor, but to what is acted upon, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The army, beaten but not conquered, prepared for a siege.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence <i>beaten</i> is the past participle of the irregular
verb <i>beat</i>, and <i>conquered</i> is the past participle of the regular
verb <i>conquer</i>,
and both modify the noun <i>army</i>, but refer to it, not as the actor,
but as the receiver of the action. Hence, the past participle is also the
<i>passive</i> participle.
</p>

<p>Note in the following sentences the use of the present and past
participle as adjectives:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <i>refreshing</i> breeze came from the hills.</li>
<li>They escaped from the <i>burning</i> building.</li>
<li><i>Toiling</i>, <i>rejoicing</i>, <i>sorrowing</i>, onward through life
he goes.</li>
<li>The man, <i>defeated</i> in his purpose, gave up in despair.</li>
<li>The child, <i>driven</i> in its youth to work, is robbed of the joy of
childhood.</li>
<li>The army, <i>forced</i> to retreat, destroyed all in its path.</li>
<li>The children, <i>neglected</i> by society, grow up without their
rightful opportunities.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>The adjectives and participles used as adjectives in the following
sentences are printed in <i>italics</i>. Determine which adjectives are
capable of comparison, and whether they are compared by adding <i>er</i> or
<i>est</i>, or by the use of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <i>a</i> community <i>regulated</i> by laws of demand and supply, but
<i>protected</i> from <i>open</i> violence, <i>the</i> persons who become <i>rich</i>
are, generally <i>speaking</i>, <i>industrious</i>,
<i>resolute</i>, <i>proud</i>, <i>covetous</i>, <i>prompt</i>,
<i>methodical</i>, <i>sensible</i>, <i>unimaginative</i>,
<i>insensitive</i> and <i>ignorant</i>. <i>The</i> persons who remain
<i>poor</i> are <i>the</i> entirely
<i>foolish</i>, <i>the</i> entirely <i>wise</i>, <i>the idle</i>, <i>the

well-informed</i>, <i>the improvident</i>, <i>the</i>
irregularly and impulsively <i>wicked</i>, <i>the clumsy</i> knave,
<i>the open</i> thief, and <i>the</i>
entirely <i>merciful</i>, <i>just</i> and <i>godly</i>
persons.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Ruskin.</i></span></p>

</blockquote>

<h3>PARTICIPLE PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_275">275.</b> If you will refer now to Lesson 9 you will find that we
studied in that lesson concerning participle phrases; that is, several words
used as a participle. We found that these participle phrases may also be
used as nouns; as, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>His having joined the union caused him to lose his position.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Having joined</i> is here a participle phrase used as a noun, subject
of the verb <i>caused</i>. Participle phrases may also be used as
adjectives.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_155" title="pg 155"></a>
You remember that we had four participle phrases, as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Present perfect</b>, <i>active</i>, having called.</li>
<li><b>Present perfect</b>, <i>passive</i>, having been called.</li>
<li><b>Progressive</b>, <i>active</i>, having been calling.</li>
<li><b>Progressive</b>, <i>passive</i>, being called.</li>
</ul>

<p>These participle phrases are used as adjectives to describe and
modify nouns, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The soldier, <i>having joined</i> his comrades, fought in the trenches.</li>
<li>The nurse, <i>having been watching</i> for days, was nearly exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The passive phrases also are used as adjectives, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The woman, <i>having been hired</i> by the manager, went to work.</li>
<li>The man, <i>being attacked</i>, fought bravely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the participle phrases <i>having been hired</i> and <i>being
attacked</i> are used as adjectives to modify the nouns <i>woman</i> and <i>man</i>.
</p>

<p>Use the participles and participle phrases of the verbs <i>see</i> and
<i>obey</i> in sentences of your own.
</p>

<h3>USES OF ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_276">276.</b> In our use of adjectives, we find it convenient to use them
in several different ways. The most common use is closely connected
with the noun as a modifying word, seeming in a sense almost a part of
the noun; as in the sentence, <i>These brave men have bequeathed to us
splendid victories</i>. In this sentence <i>these</i> and <i>brave</i>
are easily discovered
to be adjectives, being used in such close connection with the noun.
</p>

<p>But sometimes we find the adjectives a little farther away from the
noun which it describes, and then it becomes a little more difficult to
find. You will recall, in our study of the copulative verb <i>be</i>,
that we
found it was simply a connecting word, connecting that which followed
the verb with its subject. So we often find an adjective used in the
predicate with a copulative verb showing what is asserted of the
subject.
When an adjective is used in this way, it modifies the subject just as
much as if it were directly connected by being placed immediately
before the noun. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The lesson was long and difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Long</i> and <i>difficult</i> are used in the predicate after the copulative
verb <i>was</i>, but are used to modify the subject <i>lesson</i> just as much as
though we said instead, <i>It was a long and difficult lesson</i>. So watch
carefully for adjectives used with the copulative verb <i>be</i> in all its forms,
<i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>; and the
phrases, <i>has been</i>, <i>will be</i>, <i>must be</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_277">277.</b> You may find adjectives also used following the noun. As,
for example: <i>The man, cool and resolute, awaited the attack.</i> <i>Cool</i> and
<i>resolute</i> are adjectives modifying the noun <i>man</i>, but they follow the
noun, instead of being placed before it.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_156" title="pg 156"></a>
COMMON ERRORS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_278">278.</b>  There are a number of common errors which we make in
comparison, which we should be careful to avoid.
</p>

<p>1. A number of adjectives cannot be compared for they in themselves
express the highest degree of quality, so they have no shades of
meaning and will not admit of comparison. For example: <i>full</i>, <i>empty</i>,
<i>level</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>square</i>. If a thing is full or empty or level or round or
square, it cannot be more full, or more empty, or more level, or more
round, or more square. So do not compare adjectives that already express
the highest degree of a quality. Also such words as <i>supreme</i>,
<i>eternal</i>, and <i>infallible</i>, cannot be compared for they also express the
highest degree of quality.
</p>

<p>2. Do not use <i>more</i> with the comparative form made by using
<i>er</i>, or <i>most</i> with the superlative form, made by using <i>est</i>. For
example: do not say, <i>They cannot be more happier than they are</i>. Say,
<i>They cannot be happier</i>; or <i>They cannot be more happy</i>. Use either form but
never both. Do not say, <i>That is the most wisest plan</i>. Say either,
<i>That is the wisest plan</i>; or <i>That is the most wise plan</i>, but never use
both forms. Never use <i>most</i> with a superlative form.
</p>

<p>3. Do not use the superlative form in comparing <i>two</i> objects.
The superlative form is used only when more than two are compared.
For example; do not say, <i>He is the smallest of the two</i>. Say,
<i>He is the smaller of the two</i>. <i>Which is the largest end?</i> is incorrect.
<i>Which is the larger end?</i> is correct. <i>Which is the oldest, John or
Henry?</i> is also incorrect. This should be, <i>Which is the older, John or Henry?</i> Use
the <i>comparative</i> form always when comparing <i>two</i> objects.
</p>

<p>4. In stating a comparison, avoid comparing a thing with itself.
For example; <i>New York is larger than any city in the United
States</i>. In this sentence, when you say <i>any</i> city in the United States, you
are including New York; so you are really comparing New York with
itself, and you are saying that New York is larger than itself. You
should have said, <i>New York is larger than any other city in the
United States</i>; or, <i>New York is the largest city in the United
States</i>. When
you compare an object with all others of its kind be sure that the word
<i>other</i> follows the comparative word <i>than</i>.
</p>

<p>5. When an adjective denoting <i>one</i> or <i>more than one</i>
modifies a noun, the adjective and the noun must agree in number. For example;
<i>The house is 30 foot square</i>. <i>Thirty</i> denotes more than one,
so a plural noun should be used, and this sentence should be, <i>The house is 30
feet square</i>. <i>We are traveling at the rate of 40 mile an hour.</i> This
should be, <i>We are traveling at the rate of 40 miles an hour</i>.
</p>

<p>6.  Only two adjectives, <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> change their form
when modifying a plural noun. <i>These</i> and <i>those</i> are the plural
forms of <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>. So remember always to use <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>
with singular nouns and <i>these</i> and <i>those</i> with plural nouns. For example; do not
say, <i>These kind of people will never join us</i>. You should say, <i>This kind of
people will never join us</i>. Or, <i>Those sort of flowers grows easily</i>.
You should say, <i>That sort of flowers grows easily</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_157" title="pg 157"></a>
7. Place your adjectives where there can be no doubt as to what
you intend them to modify. Put the adjective <i>with</i> the noun which
it modifies. For example; do not say, <i>a fresh bunch of flowers</i>, <i>a new
pair of shoes</i>, <i>a salt barrel of pork</i>, <i>an old box of
clothes</i>, <i>a cold cup of
water</i>, <i>a new load of hay</i>. Put the adjective with the noun
which it modifies, and say, <i>a bunch of fresh flowers</i>, <i>a pair of new
shoes</i>, <i>a barrel of salt pork</i>, <i>a box of old clothes</i>, <i>a cup of cold
water</i>, <i>a load of new hay</i>.
</p>

<p>8. Adjectives are usually placed before the nouns they qualify,
but sometimes, especially in poetry or in the use of participles, they
follow the nouns. They should not, however, be placed too far away from
the noun which they modify or be unnecessarily separated from the
noun. Where there are two or more adjectives used to qualify the same
noun, place nearest the noun the adjective most closely connected with
the object described and place farthest from the noun the adjective
least closely connected with the noun. If they are all of the same rank,
place them where they will sound best, usually according to their
length, naming the shortest adjective first.
</p>

<p>Correct the following sentences by arranging the adjectives in the
proper order:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The summer sky was a blue, soft, beautiful sky.</li>
<li>He bought a brown, fine, big horse.</li>
<li>A gold, beautiful, expensive watch was given her.</li>
<li>The new, beautiful apartment building is on the corner.</li>
<li>He advertised for a young, intelligent, wide awake man.</li>
</ul>

<p>9. Never use <i>them</i> as an adjective. <i>Them</i> is a pronoun. One
of the worst mistakes which we can make is to use such phrases as <i>them
things</i>, <i>them men</i>, <i>them books</i>. Say, <i>those
things</i>, <i>those men</i>, <i>those books</i>.
</p>

<p>10. Do not use <i>less</i> for the comparative form of <i>few</i>. The
comparative form of <i>few</i> is <i>fewer</i>. <i>Less</i> refers only to quantity,
<i>fewer</i> to number. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He raised <i>less</i> grain this year than last, because he has
<i>fewer</i> horses now than he had <span class="corr" title="them">then</span>.</li>

<li>He uses <i>fewer</i> words because he has <i>less</i> to say.</li>

<li>There are but <i>few</i> people here today; there were still
<i>fewer</i> (not less) yesterday.</li>

</ul>

<p class="center">THE COLLECTION</p>
<p>I passed the plate in church.</p>

<p>There was a little silver, but the crisp bank-notes heaped themselves up
high before me;
</p>

<p>And ever as the pile grew, the plate became warmer and warmer, until it
fairly burned my fingers, and a smell of scorching flesh rose from it,
and I perceived that some of the notes were beginning to smolder and
curl, half-browned, at the edges.
</p>

<p>And then I saw through the smoke into the very substance of the money,
and I beheld what it really was:
I saw the stolen earnings of the poor, the wide margin of wages pared
down to starvation;
</p>

<p>I saw the underpaid factory girl eking out her living on the street, and
the over-worked child, and the suicide of the discharged miner;
I saw the poisonous gases from great manufactories, spreading disease
and death;
</p>

<p>I saw despair and drudgery filling the dram-shop;
I saw rents screwed out of brother men for permission to live on God's
land;
</p>

<p>I saw men shut out from the bosom of the earth and begging for the poor
privilege to work, in vain, and becoming tramps and paupers and
drunkards and lunatics, and crowding into almshouses, insane asylums and
prisons;
</p>

<p>I saw ignorance and vice and crime growing rank in stifling, filthy
slums;
</p>

<p>I saw shoddy cloth and adulterated food and lying goods of all kinds,
cheapening men and women, and vulgarizing the world;
I saw hideousness extending itself from coal-mine and foundry over
forest and river and field;
</p>

<p>I saw money grabbed from fellow grabbers and swindled from fellow
swindlers, and underneath the workman forever spinning it out of his
vitals;
</p>

<p>I saw the laboring world, thin and pale and bent and care-worn and
driven, pouring out this tribute from its toil and sweat into the laps
of the richly dressed men and women in the pews, who only glanced at
them to shrink from them with disgust;
</p>

<p>I saw all this, and the plate burned my fingers so that I had to hold it
first in one hand and then in the other; and I was glad when the parson
in his white robes took the smoking pile from me on the chancel steps
and, turning about, lifted it up and laid it on the altar.
</p>

<p>It was an old-time altar, indeed, for it bore a burnt offering of flesh
and blood&mdash;a sweet savor unto the Moloch whom these people worship with
their daily round of human sacrifices.

<p>The shambles are in the temple as of yore, and the tables of the
money-changers waiting to be overturned.

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 15</h2>

<p>There is a class of words having the sound of long <i>e</i>, represented
by the diphthong <i>ie</i>, and another class having the same sound
represented by <i>ei</i>. It is a matter of perplexity at times to determine whether
one of these words should be spelled with <i>ie</i> or <i>ei</i>. Here is a
little rhyme which you will find a valuable aid to the memory in spelling these
words:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When the letter <i>c</i> you spy,</li>
<li>Put the <i>e</i> before the <i>i</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, in such words as <i>deceit</i>, <i>receive</i> and
<i>ceiling</i>, the spelling
is <i>ei</i>. On the other hand, when the diphthong is not preceded by
the letter <i>c</i>, the spelling is <i>ie</i>, as in <i>grief</i>,
<i>field</i>, <i>siege</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as <i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>,
<i>leisure</i>, <i>seize</i> and <i>weird</i>. Most words, however,
conform to the rule&mdash;when
preceded by <i>c</i>, <i>ei</i> should be used; when preceded by any
other letter, <i>ie</i>.
</p>

<p>Observe that this rule applies only when there is a diphthong having
the sound of long <i>e</i>. When the two letters do not have the sound
of long <i>e</i>, as in <i>ancient</i>, the rule does not apply.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 16</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We have been tracing the development of written speech in order
that we might have a clearer understanding of our own language. We
have found how our earliest ancestors communicated with each other
by signs and an articulate speech that was probably a little better than
that of some animals of today. They gradually developed this articulate
speech and then began to have need for some form of written speech.
That which distinguishes man from the animals primarily is his power
to remember and to associate one idea with another. From this comes
his ability to reason concerning the connection of these ideas. Without
this power of associative memory we would not be able to reason. If
you could not recall the things that happened yesterday and had not
the power of imagination concerning the things that may happen tomorrow,
your reasoning concerning today would not be above that of
the animals.
</p>

<p>So man soon found it necessary to have some way of recalling
accurately, in a manner that he could depend upon, the things that
happened yesterday and the day before and still farther back in time.
So that his first step was the invention of simple aids to memory such
as the knotted strings and tally sticks. Then he began to draw pictures
of the objects about him which he could perceive by the five senses,
the things which he could see and hear and touch and taste and smell.
</p>

<p>But man, the Thinker, began to develop and he began to have ideas
about things which he could not see and hear and touch and taste and
smell. He began to think of abstract ideas such as light and darkness,
love and hate, and if he was to have written speech he must have symbols
which would express these ideas. So we have found that he used
pictures of the things he perceived with his five senses to symbolize
some of his abstract ideas, as for example; a picture of the sun and
moon to represent light; the bee to symbolize industry; the ostrich feather
to represent justice. But as his ideas began to develop you can readily
see that in the course of time there were not enough symbols to go
around and this sort of written speech became very confusing and very
difficult to read.
</p>

<p>Necessity is truly the mother of invention, and so this need of man
forced him to invent something entirely new&mdash;something which had
been undreamed of before. He began now to use pictures which were
different in sense but the names of which had the same sound. You
can find an example of this same thing on the Children's Puzzle Page
in the rebus which is given for the children to solve. As for example:
A picture of an eye, a saw, a boy, a swallow, a goose and a berry, and
this would stand for the sentence, I saw a boy swallow a gooseberry.
</p>

<p>Perhaps you have used the same idea in some guessing game where
a mill, a walk and a key stands for Milwaukee. And so we have a new
<a class="pagenum" id="page_161" title="pg 161"></a>
form of picture writing. Notice in this that an entirely new idea has
entered in, for the picture may not stand for the whole word but may
stand for one syllable of the word as in the example given above. The
mill stands for one syllable, walk for another and key for another. This
was a great step for it meant the division of the word into various
sounds represented by the syllables.
</p>

<p>What a new insight it gives us into life when we realize that not
only our bodies but the environment in which we live, the machines with
which we work and even the language which we use has been a product
of man's own effort. Man has developed these things for himself through
a constant and steady evolution. It makes us feel that we are part of
one stupendous whole; we belong to the class which has done the work
of the world and accomplished these mighty things. The same blood
flows in us; the same power belongs to us. Truly, with this idea, we
can stand erect and look the whole world in the face and demand the
opportunity to live our own lives to the full.

<h3>WORDS ADDED TO VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_279">279.</b> We have just finished the study of adjectives and we have
found that adjectives are words added to nouns to qualify or to limit
their meaning. Without this class of words it would be impossible for
us to express all of our ideas, for we would be at a loss to describe
the objects about us. Adjectives enable us to name the qualities or tell
the number of the objects with which we come in contact.
</p>

<p>The verb, we have found, expresses the action of these objects;
in other words, the verb tells what things do. So with adjectives and
verbs we can describe the objects named by the nouns and tell what they
do. For example, I may say, <i>Men work</i>. Here I have used simply a
noun and a verb; then I may add various adjectives to this and say,
<i>Strong, industrious, ambitious men work</i>. By the use of these
adjectives, I have told you about the kind of men who work; but I have said nothing
about the action expressed in the verb <i>work</i>. I may want to tell
you <i>how</i> they work and <i>when</i> they work; <i>where</i> they work and <i>how
much</i>; in other words, describe fully the action expressed in the verb
<i>work</i>, so I say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The men work busily.</li>
<li>The men work late.</li>
<li>The men work well.</li>
<li>The men work inside.</li>
<li>The men work hard.</li>
<li>The men work here.</li>
<li>The men work now.</li>
<li>The men work more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Words like <i>busily</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>late</i>, <i>here</i>,
<i>well</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>inside</i>, and <i>more</i>,
show <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i> and <i>how much</i> the men
work.
</p>

<p>We could leave off these words and still have a sentence, since the
other words make sense without them, but these words describe the
action expressed in the verb.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_162" title="pg 162"></a>
Words used in this way are called adverbs because they are added
to verbs to make our meaning more definite, very much as adjectives
are added to nouns.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_280">280.</b>  The word adverb means, literally, <i>to the verb</i>, and
one would suppose from this name that the adverb was strictly a verb modifier,
but an adverb is used to modify other words as well. An adverb may
be used to modify an adjective; for example, we might say: <i>The man
was very busy</i>. <i>This lesson is too long.</i> Here <i>very</i> and
<i>too</i> are added
to the adjectives <i>busy</i> and <i>long</i> to qualify their meaning.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_281">281.</b>  You remember in the comparison of adjectives, we used the
words <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> to make the comparative and superlative degrees.
Here <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> are adverbs used with the adjectives to
qualify their meaning. Adverbs used in this way will always answer the question,
<i>how much</i>, <i>how long</i>, etc. In the sentence, <i>The man is
very busy</i>, <i>very</i> is used to answer the question <i>how</i> busy. And in the
sentence, <i>The lesson is too long</i>, the adverb <i>too</i> answers the
question <i>how</i> long.
</p>

<p>An adverb is also added to another adverb sometimes to answer
the question <i>how</i>. For example; we say, <i>The man
works very hard</i>.
Here the adverb <i>hard</i> tells <i>how</i> the man works and
<i>very</i> modifies the adverb
<i>hard</i>, and answers the question <i>how hard</i>. So we have our
definition of an adverb:
</p>

<p><b id="sec_282">282.</b> <b>An adverb is a word that modifies the meaning of a verb,
an adjective or another adverb.</b>
</p>

<p>Remember that adjectives are used only with nouns or pronouns,
but the adverb may be used with a verb or an adjective or another
adverb. You remember that we had in our first lesson, as the definition of
a word, that, <i>a word is a sign of an idea</i>. The idea is a part of
a complete thought. See how all of these various words represent ideas, and
each does its part to help us express our thoughts.
</p>

<h3>HOW TO TELL ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_283">283.</b>  We need not have much difficulty in always being able to
tell which words in a sentence are adverbs, for they will always answer
one of the following questions: <i>How?</i> <i>When?</i> <i>Where?</i>
<i>Why?</i> <i>How
long?</i> <i>How often?</i> <i>How much?</i> <i>How far?</i> or <i>How
little?</i> etc. Just ask
one of these questions and the word that answers it is the adverb in
your sentence. Take the following sentence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He <i>always</i> came <i>down too rapidly</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The word <i>always</i> answers the question <i>when</i>. So
<i>always</i> is an adverb,
describing the time of the action expressed in the verb <i>came</i>&mdash;He
<i>always</i> came. <i>Down</i> answers the question <i>where</i>. So
<i>down</i> is the adverb describing the <i>place</i> of the action. <i>Rapidly</i> answers
the question <i>how</i>, and is the adverb describing the <i>manner</i> of the
action. <i>Too</i> also
answers the question <i>how</i>, and modifies the adverb <i>rapidly</i>.
</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_163" title="pg 163"></a>
Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Underscore the adverbs in the following sentences and tell which
word they modify:</p>

<ol>
<li>He writes correctly.</li>
<li>She answered quickly.</li>
<li>A very wonderful future awaits us.</li>
<li>You should not speak so hastily.</li>
<li>You can speak freely here.</li>
<li>He could never wait patiently.</li>
<li>We very often make mistakes.</li>
<li>She very seldom goes there.</li>
<li>He usually walks very rapidly.</li>
<li>I have read the lesson quite carefully.</li>
<li>We would willingly and cheerfully give our all for the cause.</li>
<li>He frequently comes here but I do not expect him today.</li>
<li>If we work diligently and faithfully we will soon learn to speak correctly and fluently.</li>
<li>I am almost sure I can go there tomorrow.</li>
<li>It was more beautifully painted than the other.</li>
<li>We eagerly await the news from the front.</li>
<li>He always gladly obeyed his father.</li>
<li>She spoke quite simply and met with a very enthusiastic reception.</li>
<li>The difficulty can be easily and readily adjusted.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Use the following adverbs in sentences to modify verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>slowly</li>
<li>here</li>
<li>now</li>
<li>gently</li>
<li>loudly</li>
<li>never</li>
<li>soon</li>
<li>carefully</li>
<li>nobly</li>
<li>down</li>
<li>seldom</li>
<li>easily</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following adverbs in sentences to modify adjectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>quite</li>
<li>very</li>
<li>more</li>
<li>too</li>
<li>most</li>
<li>less</li>
<li>nearly</li>
<li>so</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following adverbs in sentences to modify adverbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>too</li>
<li>very</li>
<li>quite</li>
<li>less</li>
<li>more</li>
<li>most</li>
<li>least</li>
<li>so</li>
</ul>


<h3>CLASSES OF ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_284">284.</b> There are a good many adverbs in our language, yet they
may be divided, according to their meaning, into six principal classes:
</p>

<p><b>1. Adverbs of time.</b>  These answer the question <i>when</i>, and
are such adverbs as <i>now</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>soon</i>, <i>never</i>,
<i>always</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b>2. Adverbs of place.</b> These answer the question <i>where</i>, and
are such adverbs as <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>yonder</i>, <i>down</i>,
<i>above</i>, <i>below</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b>3. Adverbs of manner.</b> These answer the question <i>how</i>, and
are such adverbs as <i>well</i>, <i>ill</i>, <i>thus</i>, <i>so</i>,
<i>slowly</i>, <i>hastily</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_164" title="pg 164"></a>
<b>4. Adverbs of degree.</b> These answer the questions <i>how much</i>,
<i>how little</i>, <i>how far</i>, etc., and are such adverbs as
<i>much</i>, <i>very</i>, <i>almost</i>,
<i>scarcely</i>, <i>hardly</i>, <i>more</i>, <i>quite</i>,
<i>little</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b>5. Adverbs of cause.</b> These answer the question <i>why</i>, and
are such adverbs as <i>therefore</i>, <i>accordingly</i>, <i>hence</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b>6. Adverbs of number.</b>  These are such adverbs as <i>first</i>,
<i>second</i>, <i>third</i>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>In the following sentences there are adverbs of each class used.
Find the adverbs of the different classes.</p>

<ol>
<li>We shall always be found in the forefront of the struggle.</li>
<li>It is much more effective to train the young.</li>
<li>He came first and remained through the entire program.</li>
<li>It is pleasant to know that we have done well.</li>
<li>Our comrades are fighting yonder in the trenches.</li>
<li>Therefore we shall never acknowledge defeat.</li>
<li>Come down and discuss the matter with us.</li>
<li>We would soon be able to agree if we understood the facts.</li>
<li>Study your lessons slowly and carefully.</li>
<li>He was scarcely able to tell his story.</li>
<li>Accordingly I am sending you full particulars of the plan.</li>
<li>He came third in the ranks.</li>
</ol>


<h3>INTERROGATIVE ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_285">285.</b> The adverbs <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>,
<i>why</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>whence</i>, etc.,
are used in asking questions, and when they are used in this way they
are called interrogative adverbs. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>How</i> did it happen?</li>
<li><i>Where</i> are you going?</li>
<li><i>Whence</i> came he?</li>
<li><i>When</i> did he come?</li>
<li><i>Why</i> did you do it?</li>
<li><i>Whither</i> are you going?</li>
</ul>

<p>These adverbs, <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>why</i>,
<i>whence</i> and <i>whither</i>, are
used in these sentences to modify the verbs and ask the questions
concerning the <i>time</i> or <i>place</i> or <i>manner</i> of action expressed in
the verb.
</p>

<p><i>How</i> may also be used as an interrogative adverb modifying an
adjective or another adverb. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How late did he stay?</li>
<li>How large is the house?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the adverb <i>how</i> modifies the adverb
<i>late</i>, and introduces the question. In the second sentence <i>how</i> modifies the
adjective <i>large</i> and introduces the question.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Write sentences containing the interrogative adverbs <i>how</i>,
<i>when</i>, <i>where</i> and <i>why</i>, to modify verbs and ask simple questions.
</p>

<p>Write sentences using the interrogative adverb <i>how</i> to modify an
adjective and an adverb and to introduce a question.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_165" title="pg 165"></a>
ADVERBS OF MODE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_286">286.</b>  There are some adverbs which scarcely fall into any of the
above classes and cannot be said to answer any of these questions.
They are such adverbs as <i>indeed</i>, <i>certainly</i>, <i>fairly</i>,
<i>truly</i>, <i>surely</i>, <i>perhaps</i>
and <i>possibly</i>. These adverbs really modify the entire sentence, in
a way, and are used to show how the statement is made,&mdash;whether in a positive
or negative way or in a doubtful way. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Surely</i> you will not leave me.</li>
<li><i>Truly</i> I cannot understand the matter as you do.</li>
<li><i>Perhaps</i> he knows no better.</li>
<li><i>Indeed</i>, I cannot go with you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, these adverbs, <i>truly</i>, <i>surely</i>, <i>perhaps</i> and
<i>indeed</i>, show the
manner in which the entire statement is made; so they have been put in
a class by themselves and called <b>adverbs of mode</b>. <i>Mode</i>
means literally <i>manner</i>, but these are not adverbs that express manner
of action, like <i>slowly</i> or <i>wisely</i> or <i>well</i> or
<i>ill</i>. They express rather the manner
in which the entire statement is made, and so really modify the whole
sentence.
</p>

<h3>PHRASE ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_287">287.</b>  We have certain little phrases which we have used so often
that they have come to be used and regarded as single adverbs. They
are such phrases as <i>of course</i>, <i>of late</i>, <i>for good</i>,
<i>of old</i>, <i>at all</i>, <i>at length</i>,
<i>by and by</i>, <i>over and over</i>, <i>again and again</i>,
<i>through and through</i>, <i>hand in
hand</i>, <i>ere long</i>, <i>in vain</i>, <i>to and fro</i>, <i>up and
down</i>, <i>as usual</i>, <i>by far</i>, <i>at last</i>,
<i>at least</i>, <i>in general</i>, <i>in short</i>, etc. These words
which we find used so
often in these phrases we may count as single adverbs.
</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_288">288.</b>  Sometimes the same word may be used either as an adjective
or as an adverb, and you may have some difficulty in telling whether
it is an adjective or an adverb. Some of these words are: <i>better</i>,
<i>little</i>, <i>late</i>, <i>far</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>further</i>, <i>first</i>,
<i>last</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>more</i> and
<i>high</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>late</i> news verifies our statement.</li>
<li>The man came <i>late</i> to his work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the word <i>late</i> is used as an adjective
modifying the noun <i>news</i>. In the second sentence, the word <i>late</i> is
used as an adverb to modify the verb <i>came</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_289">289.</b>  You can always distinguish between adjectives and adverbs
by this rule: Adjectives modify <i>only nouns</i> and <i>pronouns</i>,
and the one essential characteristic of the adverb, as a limiting word, is that it
is <i>always</i> joined to some other part of speech than a noun. An
adverb may modify a verb, adjective or other adverb, but never a noun or
pronoun.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_166" title="pg 166"></a>
You recall the rule which we have made the very foundation of
our study: namely, that every word is classified in the sentence
according to the <i>work</i> which it does in that sentence. So a word is an
adjective when it limits or modifies or qualifies a noun or pronoun;
a word is an adverb when it qualifies any part of speech other than a
noun or pronoun, either a verb or an adjective or an adverb, or even an
entire sentence, as is the case with adverbs of mode.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_290">290.</b> Many adverbs are regularly made from nouns and adjectives
by prefixes and suffixes. Adverbs are made from adjectives chiefly by
adding the suffix <i>ly</i>, or by changing <i>ble</i> to <i>bly</i>.
For example: <i>honestly</i>,
<i>rarely</i>, <i>dearly</i>, <i>ably</i>, <i>nobly</i>, <i>feebly</i>.
But all words that end in <i>ly</i> are not
adverbs. Some adjectives end in <i>ly</i> also, as, <i>kingly</i>,
<i>courtly</i>, etc. The
only way we can determine to which class a word belongs is by its use
in the sentence.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, tell whether the words printed in italics
are used as adjectives or as adverbs: also note the words ending in
<i>ly</i>. Some are adverbs and some adjectives.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The boy was very <i>little</i>.</li>
<li>It was a <i>little</i> early to arrive.</li>
<li>It was a <i>hard</i> lesson.</li>
<li>She works <i>hard</i> every day.</li>
<li>I read the <i>first</i> book.</li>
<li>I read the book <i>first</i> then gave it to him.</li>
<li>He went to a <i>high</i> mountain.</li>
<li>The eagle flew <i>high</i> in the air.</li>
<li>We saw clearly the lovely picture.</li>
<li>He is a wonderfully jolly man.</li>
<li>His courtly manner failed when he saw his homely bride.</li>
<li>He speaks slowly and clearly.</li>
<li>They are very cleanly in their habits.</li>
</ol>


<h3>NOUNS AS ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_291">291.</b> Words that are ordinarily used as nouns, are sometimes used
as adverbs. These are the nouns that denote time, distance, measure of
value or direction. They are added to verbs and adjectives to denote
the definite time at which a thing took place, or to denote the extent
of time or distance and the measure of value, of weight, number or age.
They are sometimes used to indicate direction. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>They were gone a <i>year</i>.</li>
<li>He talked an <i>hour</i>.</li>
<li>They will return next <i>week</i>.</li>
<li>They went <i>south</i> for the winter.</li>
<li>They traveled 100 <i>miles</i>.</li>
<li>The wheat is a <i>foot</i> high.</li>
<li>The man weighed 200 <i>pounds</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, the nouns, <i>year</i>, <i>miles</i>, <i>hour</i>,
<i>foot</i>, <i>week</i>, <i>pounds</i>
and <i>south</i> are used as adverbs. Remember every word is classified
according to the work which it does in the sentence.
</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 16</h2>

<p>The English language is truly a melting pot, into which have been
thrown words from almost every language under the sun. This makes
our spelling very confusing many times. Because of this also, we have
in our language, words which have the same sound but different meaning,
having come into the language from different sources. These words
are called <i>homonyms</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Homonyms are words having the same sound but different
meaning.</b> For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Plane, plain; </li>
<li>write, right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Synonyms are words which have the same meaning. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow, permit; </li>
<li>lazy, idle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our spelling lesson for this week contains a list of most of the
commonly used homonyms. Look up the meaning in the dictionary and
use them correctly in sentences. You will note that in some instances
there are three different words which have the same sound, but different
meanings.
</p>

<p>Notice especially <i>principal</i> and <i>principle</i>. Perhaps there
are no two words which we use frequently which are so confused in their
spelling. <i>Principle</i> is a noun. <i>Principal</i> is an adjective. You can
remember the correct spelling by remembering that <i>adjective</i> begins with
<i>a</i>. <i>Principal</i>,
the adjective, is spelled with an <i>a</i>, <i>pal</i>.
</p>

<p>Notice also the distinction between <i>two</i>, <i>to</i> and
<i>too</i>. Look these
up carefully, for mistakes are very often made in the use of these three
words. Also notice the words <i>no</i> and <i>know</i> and <i>here</i>
and <i>hear</i>.
</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 17</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We are finishing in this lesson the study of a very important part
of speech. Adverbs are a necessary part of our vocabulary, and most
of us need a greater supply than we at present possess. We usually
have a few adverbs and adjectives in our vocabulary which are
continually overworked. Add a few new ones to your vocabulary this
week.
</p>

<p>Do not slight the exercises in these lessons. The study of the
lesson is only the beginning of the theoretical knowledge. You do
not really know a thing until you put it into practice. You may take
a correspondence course on how to run an automobile but you can not
really know how to run a machine until you have had the practical
experience. There is only one way to become expert in the use of words
and that is to use them. Every day try to talk to some one who thinks
and reads. While talking watch their language and your own. When
a word is used that you do not fully understand, look it up at your
very first opportunity and if you like the word use it a number of times
until it has become your word.
</p>

<p>We have been following in these letters, which are our weekly talks
together, the development of the alphabet. It is really a wonderful
story. It brings to us most vividly the struggle of the men of the past.
Last week we found how they began to use symbols to express syllables,
parts of a word. We found that this was a great step in advance. Do
you not see that this was not an eye picture but an ear picture? The
symbol did not stand for the picture of the object it named but each
symbol stood for the sound which composed part of the word.
</p>

<p>After a while it dawned upon some one that all the words which
man used were expressed by just a few sounds. We do not know just
when this happened but we do know that it was a wonderful step in
advance. Cumbersome pictures and symbols could be done away with
now. The same idea could be expressed by a few signs which represented
the few sounds which were used over and over again in all words.
Let us not fail to realize what a great step in advance this was. These
symbols represented sounds. The appeal was through the <i>ear gate</i>
of man, not through the <i>eye gate</i>.
</p>

<p>Thus came about the birth of the alphabet, one of the greatest
and most momentous triumphs of the human mind. Because of this
discovery, we can now form thousands of combinations expressing all
our ideas with only twenty-three or twenty-four symbols,&mdash;letters that
represent sounds. Since we have at our command all of this rich fund
of words, let us not be content to possess only a few for ourselves. Add
a word daily to your vocabulary and you will soon be surprised at the
ease and fluency of your spoken and written speech; and with this
fluency in speech will come added power in every part of your life.

<h3>COMPARISON OF ADVERBS<a class="pagenum" id="page_170" title="pg 170"></a></h3>

<p><b id="sec_292">292.</b> You will recall that we found that adjectives change in form
to show different degrees of quality. A few adverbs are compared
the same as adjectives. Some form the comparative and superlative
degree in the regular way, just as adjectives, by adding <i>er</i> and
<i>est</i>; for example:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>       <th class="sub">Comparative</th>       <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>soon</td>             <td>sooner</td>             <td>soonest</td></tr>
<tr><td>late</td>             <td>later</td>              <td>latest</td></tr>
<tr><td>often</td>            <td>oftener</td>            <td>oftenest</td></tr>
<tr><td>early</td>            <td>earlier</td>            <td>earliest</td></tr>
<tr><td>fast</td>             <td>faster</td>             <td>fastest</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_293">293.</b> Most adverbs form their comparative and superlative by the
use of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> or <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>, just
as adjectives do; for example:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>       <th class="sub">Comparative</th>       <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>clearly</td>          <td>more clearly</td>       <td>most clearly</td></tr>
<tr><td>nobly</td>            <td>more nobly</td>         <td>most nobly</td></tr>
<tr><td>ably</td>             <td>more ably</td>          <td>most ably</td></tr>
<tr><td>truly</td>            <td>more truly</td>         <td>most truly</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Or, in the descending comparison:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>clearly</td>           <td>less clearly</td>       <td>least clearly</td></tr>
<tr><td>nobly</td>             <td>less nobly</td>         <td>least nobly</td></tr>
<tr><td>ably</td>              <td>less ably</td>          <td>least ably</td></tr>
<tr><td>truly</td>             <td>less truly</td>         <td>least truly</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_294">294.</b> The following adverbs are compared irregularly. It would
be well to memorize this list:</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Positive</th>       <th class="sub">Comparative</th>       <th class="sub">Superlative</th></tr>

<tr><td>ill</td>               <td>worse</td>              <td>worst</td></tr>
<tr><td>well</td>              <td>better</td>             <td>best</td></tr>
<tr><td>badly</td>             <td>worse</td>              <td>worst</td></tr>
<tr><td>far</td>               <td>further (farther)</td>  <td>furthest (farthest)</td></tr>
<tr><td>little</td>            <td>less</td>               <td>least</td></tr>
<tr><td>much</td>              <td>more</td>               <td>most</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some adverbs are incapable of comparison, as <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>,
<i>now</i>, <i>today</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>therefore</i>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences mark which adverbs are used in the
positive, which in the comparative and which in the superlative degree:
</p>
<ol>
<li>He came too late to get his letter.</li>
<li>I can understand clearly since you have explained the matter
to me.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_171" title="pg 171"></a>
He speaks most truly concerning a matter of which he is well
informed.</li>
<li>If he comes quickly he will arrive in time.</li>
<li>I will be able to speak more effectively when I have studied
the subject.</li>
<li>Those who argue most ably are those who are in complete
possession of the facts.</li>
<li>He needs to take a course such as this very badly.</li>
<li>I am too weary to go farther today.</li>
<li>This is the least expensive of them all.</li>
<li>If he arrives later in the day I will not be able to see him.</li>
<li>I can understand him more clearly than I can his friend.</li>
<li>You must work more rapidly under the Taylor system of
efficiency.</li>
<li>Those who are least trained lose their positions first.</li>
<li>Those who are best fitted for the positions do not always receive them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>POSITION OF ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_295">295.</b> When we use an adverb with an adjective or other adverb,
we usually place the adverb before the adjective or adverb which it
modifies. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>She is <i>very</i> studious.</li>
<li>Results come <i>rather</i> slowly.</li>
<li>It is <i>quite</i> evident.</li>
<li>He speaks <i>too</i> rapidly.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we use an adverb with the simple form of the verb, (that
is, either the present or past time form or any time form in which we
do not need to use a phrase), if the verb is a complete verb, we place
the adverb after the verb. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The boat arrived <i>safely</i>.</li>
<li>The man came <i>quickly</i>.</li>
<li>The boy ran <i>fast</i>.</li>
<li>The teacher spoke <i>hastily</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when the verb is an incomplete verb used in the simple form,
the adverb usually precedes it in order not to come between the verb
and its object. As, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He <i>willingly</i> gave his consent to the proposition.</li>
<li>She <i>gladly</i> wrote the letter which we requested.</li>
<li>A soldier <i>always</i> obeys the command of a superior officer.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the object of the incomplete verb is short, then the adverb
is sometimes placed after the object. As, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I study my lessons <i>carefully</i>.</li>
<li>He wrote a letter <i>hastily</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The object is more closely connected with the verb and so is placed
nearer the verb. However, when the object is modified by a phrase
the adverb is sometimes placed immediately after the verb, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I studied <i>carefully</i> the lessons given for this month.</li>
<li>He wrote <i>hastily</i> a short letter to his son.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_172" title="pg 172"></a>
When we use an adverb with a verb phrase, we usually place the
adverb after the first word in the verb phrase. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The boy has <i>always</i> worked.</li>
<li>The workers will <i>then</i> understand.</li>
<li>He will <i>surely</i> have arrived by that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the verb is in the passive form the adverb immediately precedes
the principal verb, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The work can be <i>quickly</i> finished.</li>
<li>The obstacles can be <i>readily</i> overcome.</li>
<li>The lesson must be <i>carefully</i> prepared.</li>
<li>The workers must be <i>thoroughly</i> organized.</li>
</ul>

<p>When an adverb of time and an adverb of manner or place are used
to modify the same verb, the adverb of time is placed first and the
adverb of manner or place second, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I <i>often</i> stop <i>there</i>.</li>
<li>He <i>usually</i> walks <i>very rapidly</i>.</li>
<li>They <i>soon</i> learn to work <i>rapidly</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the sentence contains adverbs of time, of place, and of manner;
the adverb of time should come first; of place, second; and of manner,
third; as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He <i>usually</i> comes <i>here quickly</i>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Improve the location of the adverbs in the following sentences
and observe how the change of place of the adverb may alter the meaning
of the sentence:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I <i>only</i> saw the President once.</li>
<li>Such prices are <i>only</i> paid in times of great scarcity.</li>
<li>No man has <i>ever</i> so much wealth that he does not want more.</li>
<li>It seems that the workers can be <i>never</i> aroused.</li>
<li>I want to <i>briefly</i> state the reason for my action.</li>
<li>I shall be glad to help you <i>always</i>.</li>
<li>I <i>only</i> mention a few of the facts.</li>
<li>He <i>nearly</i> walked to town.</li>
<li>We are told that the Japanese <i>chiefly</i> live upon rice.</li>
<li>They expected them to sign a treaty <i>daily</i>.</li>
<li>Having <i>nearly</i> lost all his money he feared <i>again</i> to venture.</li>
</ol>


<h3>ADVERBS AND INFINITIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_296">296.</b> You remember when we studied the infinitive in Lesson 9,
we found that it was not good usage to split the infinitive; that is, to
put the modifying word between <i>to</i> and the verb. For example:
<i>We ought to bravely stand for our rights</i>. The correct form of this is:
<i>We ought to stand bravely for our rights</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_173" title="pg 173"></a>
But we have found, also, that common usage breaks down the old
rules and makes new rules and laws for itself, and so we frequently find
the adverb placed between the infinitive and its sign.
</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems difficult to express our meaning accurately in
any other way; for example, when we say: <i>To almost succeed is not
enough</i>, we do not make the statement as forceful or as nearly
expressive of our real idea, if we try to put the adverb <i>almost</i> in any other
position. This is also true in such phrases as <i>to far exceed</i>, <i>to more
than counterbalance</i>, <i>to fully appreciate</i>, and various other
examples which you will readily find in your reading. The purpose of written and
spoken language is to express our ideas adequately and accurately.
</p>

<p>So we place our words in sentences to fulfill this purpose and not
according to any stereotyped rule of grammarians. Ordinarily, though,
it would be best not to place the adverb between the infinitive verb
and its sign <i>to</i>. Do not split the infinitive unless by so doing
you express your idea more accurately.
</p>

<h3>COMMON ERRORS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_297">297.</b> The position in the sentence of such adverbs as,
<i>only</i>, <i>also</i>
and <i>merely</i>, depends upon the meaning to be conveyed. The place
where these adverbs occur in the sentences, may completely alter the
meaning of the sentence. For example:
</p>

<p><i>Only the address can be written on this side.</i> We mean that
nothing but the address can be written on this side.
</p>

<p><i>The address can only be written on this side.</i> We mean that the
address cannot be printed, but must be written.
</p>

<p><i>The address can be written only on this side.</i> We mean that it
cannot be written on any other side, but on this side only.
</p>

<p>So you see that the place in which the adverb appears in the sentence
depends upon the meaning to be conveyed and the adverb should
be placed in the sentence so as to convey the meaning intended.
</p>

<p><b>Never use an adjective for an adverb.</b> One common error is
using an adjective for an adverb. Remember that adjectives modify
nouns only. Whenever you use a word to modify a verb, adjective or
another adverb, use an adverb. For example, <i>He speaks slow and
plain</i>. This is incorrect. The sentence should be, <i>He speaks slowly and
plainly</i>. Watch this carefully. It is a very common error.
</p>

<p><b>Another very common error is that of using an adverb instead
of an adjective with the copulative verb.</b> Never use an adverb in
place of an adjective to complete a copulative verb. When a verb asserts
an action on the part of the subject, the qualifying word that follows
the verb is an adverb. For example, you would say:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The sea was calm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we use an <i>adjective</i> in the predicate, for we are describing
the appearance of the sea, no action is expressed. But if we say: <i>He
spoke calmly</i>, we use the adverb <i>calmly</i>, for the verb <i>spoke</i>
expresses an action on the part of the subject, and the adverb <i>calmly</i> describes that
action,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_174" title="pg 174"></a>
it tells how he spoke. So we say: <i>The water looks clear</i>, but,
<i>We see clearly</i>. <i>She appears truthful.</i> <i>They answered
truthfully.</i> <i>She looked sweet.</i> <i>She smiled sweetly.</i>
</p>

<p>With all forms of the verb <i>be</i>, as <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>,
<i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>have been</i>,
<i>has been</i>, <i>will be</i>, etc., use an adjective in the
predicate; as, <i>He is glad</i>.
<i>I am happy.</i> <i>They were eager.</i> <i>They will be sad.</i> Use
an adjective in
the predicate with verbs like <i>look</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>taste</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>appear</i> and <i>seem</i>.
For example: <i>He looks bad.</i> <i>It smells good.</i> <i>The candy
tastes sweet</i>.
<i>The man feels fine today.</i> <i>She appears anxious.</i> <i>He seems
weary.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Never use two negative words in the same sentence.</b> The second
negative destroys the first and we really make an affirmative statement.
The two negatives neutralize each other and spoil the meaning of the
sentence. For example, never say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want no education.</li>
<li>He didn't have no money.</li>
<li>Don't say nothing to nobody.</li>
<li>She never goes nowhere.</li>
<li>He won't say nothing to you.</li>
<li>He does not know nothing about it.</li>
<li>He never stops for nothing.</li>
<li>The stingy man gives nothing to nobody.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these sentences we have used more than one negative;
<i>not</i> and <i>no</i>, or <i>not</i> and <i>nothing</i>, or
<i>never</i> and <i>no</i>, or <i>never</i> and <i>nothing</i>.
Never use these double negatives. The correct forms of these sentences
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't want any education.</li>
<li>He didn't have any money.</li>
<li>Don't say anything to any one.</li>
<li>She never goes anywhere.</li>
<li>He won't say anything to you.</li>
<li>He knows nothing about it.</li>
<li>He never stops for anything.</li>
<li>The stingy man gives nothing to any one.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Where to place the negative adverb, not.</b> In English we do not
use the negative adverb <i>not</i> with the common verb form, but when
we use <i>not</i> in a sentence, we use the auxiliary <i>do</i>. For
example, we do not say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I like it not.</li>
<li>They think not so.</li>
<li>He loves me not.</li>
<li>We strive not to succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only in poetry do we use such expressions as these. In ordinary
English, we say:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not like it.</li>
<li>They do not think so.</li>
<li>He does not love me.</li>
<li>We do not strive to succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>We often use</b> <i>here</i> <b>and</b> <i>there</i> <b>incorrectly
after the words</b> <i>this</i> <b>and</b>
<i>that</i>. <b>We often use <i>here</i> and <i>there</i> incorrectly after the words
<i>this</i> and <i>that</i>.</b>]  For example, we say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This here lesson is shorter than that there one was.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_175" title="pg 175"></a>
This should be: <i>This lesson is shorter than that one.</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring me that there book.</li>
<li>This here man will not listen.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences should read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring me that book.</li>
<li>This man will not listen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Never use <i>here</i> and <i>there</i> in this manner.</p>

<p><b>Another common mistake is using</b> <i>most</i> <b>for</b> <i>almost</i>.</p>

<p>For example, we say:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are most there.</li>
<li>I see her most every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences should read:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are almost there.</li>
<li>I see her almost every day.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Most</i> is the superlative degree of <i>much</i>, and should be used
only in that meaning.
</p>

<p><b>We often use the adjective</b> <i>real</i> <b>in place of</b>
<i>very</i> <b>or</b> <i>quite</i>, <b>to
modify an adverb or an adjective.</b>
</p>

<p>For example, we say:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was real glad to know it.</li>
<li>She looked real nice.</li>
<li>You must come real soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Say instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am very glad to know it.</li>
<li>She looked very nice.</li>
<li>You must come quite soon.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Really</i> is the adverb form of the adjective <i>real</i>. You might
have said:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am really glad to know it.</li>
</ul>

<p>But never use <i>real</i> when you mean <i>very</i> or <i>quite</i> or
<i>really</i>.
</p>

<p><b>We use the adjective</b> <i>some</i> <b>many times when we should use
the adverb</b> <i>somewhat</i>. For example, we say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am some anxious to hear from him.</li>
<li>I was some tired after my trip.</li>
</ul>

<p>What we intended to say was:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am somewhat anxious to hear from him.</li>
<li>I was somewhat tired after my trip.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Do not use</b> <i>what for</i> <b>when you mean</b> <i>why</i>. Do
not say:</p>

<ul>
<li>What did you do that for?</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_176" title="pg 176"></a>
Or worse still,</p>

<ul>
<li>What for did you do that?</li>
</ul>

<p>Say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did you do that?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Do not use</b> <i>worse</i> <b>in place of</b> <i>more</i>. Do not
say:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to go worse than I ever did.</li>
</ul>

<p>Say:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to go <i>more</i> than I ever did.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Observe the distinction between the words</b> <i>further</i>
<b>and</b> <i>farther</i>.
Farther always refers to distance, or extent. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He could go no farther that day.</li>
<li>We will go farther into the matter some other time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further means more. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>He would say nothing further in regard to the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Never use</b> <i>good</i> <b>as an adverb</b>. <i>Good</i> is always
an adjective. <i>Well</i>
is the adverb form. <i>Good</i> and <i>well</i> are compared in the same
way, <i>good</i>, <i>better</i>, <i>best</i>, and <i>well</i>, <i>better</i>,
<i>best</i>. So <i>better</i> and <i>best</i> can be used
either as adjectives or adverbs; but <i>good</i> is always an adjective.
Do not say, <i>He talks good</i>. Say, <i>He talks well</i>. Note that
<i>ill</i> is both an adjective
and an adverb and that <i>illy</i> is always incorrect.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Correct the adverbs in the following sentences. All but two of
these sentences are wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li>Come quick, I need you.</li>
<li>The boy feels badly.</li>
<li>Give me that there pencil.</li>
<li>I am some hungry.</li>
<li>The people learn slow.</li>
<li>He never stopped for nothing.</li>
<li>What did you say that for?</li>
<li>This here machine won't run.</li>
<li>I make a mistake most every time.</li>
<li>Watch careful every word.</li>
<li>The man works good.</li>
<li>The tone sounds harsh.</li>
<li>I don't want no dinner.</li>
<li>I hope it comes real soon.</li>
<li>I want to learn worse than ever.</li>
<li>She looked lovely.</li>
<li>She smiled sweet.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_177" title="pg 177"></a>
He sees good for one so old.</li>
<li>She answered correct.</li>
<li>He won't say nothing about it.</li>
<li>I will be real glad to see you.</li>
<li>That tastes sweetly.</li>
<li>The man acted too hasty.</li>
<li>We had most reached home.</li>
<li>They ride too rapid.</li>
</ol>


<h3>DO NOT USE TOO MANY ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_298">298.</b> Like adjectives it is better to use adverbs sparingly. This
is especially true of the adverbs used to intensify our meaning. Do not
use the adverbs, <i>very</i>, <i>awfully</i>, etc., with every other
word. It makes our speech sound like that of a gushing school girl, to whom everything
is <i>very, awfully sweet</i>. More than that, it does not leave us any
words to use when we really want to be intense in speech. Save these words
until the right occasion comes to use them.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Adverbs should always be placed where there can be no doubt
as to what they are intended to modify. A mistake in placing the adverb
in the sentence often alters the meaning of the sentence. Choose the
right word in each of the following sentences:
</p>
<ol>
<li>He looked glad&mdash;gladly when I told him the news.</li>
<li>Slaves have always been treated harsh&mdash;harshly.</li>
<li>I prefer my eggs boiled soft&mdash;softly.</li>
<li>The lecturer was tolerable&mdash;tolerably well informed.</li>
<li>Speak slower&mdash;more slowly so I can understand you.</li>
<li>The evening bells sound sweet&mdash;sweetly.</li>
<li>The house appears comfortable&mdash;comfortably and pleasant&mdash;pleasantly.</li>
<li>If you will come quick&mdash;quickly you can hear the music.</li>
<li>I was exceeding&mdash;exceedingly glad to hear from you.</li>
<li>The bashful young man appeared very awkward&mdash;awkwardly.</li>
<li>The young lady looked beautiful&mdash;beautifully and she sang
beautiful&mdash;beautifully.</li>
<li>I looked quick&mdash;quickly in the direction of the sound.</li>
<li>The sun is shining bright&mdash;brightly today and the grass looks
green&mdash;greenly.</li>
</ol>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 17</h2>


<p>In our study of adjectives we have found that we use them to
express some quality possessed by a noun or pronoun which they modify.
You will recall when we studied nouns, we had one class of nouns, called
abstract nouns, which were the names of qualities. So we find that
from these adjectives expressing quality we form nouns which we use
as the name of that quality.
</p>

<p>For example from the adjective <i>happy</i>, we form the noun <i>happiness</i>,
which is the name of the quality described by the adjective <i>happy</i>, by
the addition of the suffix <i>ness</i>. We use this suffix <i>ness</i> quite often in
forming these derivative nouns from adjectives but there are other suffixes
also which we use; as for example, the suffix <i>ty</i> as in <i>security</i>,
formed from the adjective <i>secure</i>, changing the <i>e</i> to
<i>i</i> and adding the suffix
<i>ty</i>. When the word ends in <i>t</i> we sometimes add only <i>y</i>
as in <i>honesty</i>, derived from the adjective <i>honest</i>.
</p>

<p>You remember that an abstract noun may express not only quality
but also action, considered apart from the actor; so abstract nouns may
be made from verbs. For example:
</p>

<p><i>Running</i>, from the verb <i>run</i>; <i>settlement</i>, from the
verb <i>settle</i>.
</p>

<p>In our lesson for this week the list for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
contains adjectives of quality from which abstract nouns expressing
quality can be made, by the addition of the proper suffix, either
<i>ness</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>ty</i> or <i>tion</i>. The list for Thursday,
Friday and Saturday consists
of verbs from which abstract nouns can be made by the addition
of the suffixes <i>ment</i> and <i>ing</i>.
</p>

<p>Make from each adjective and verb in this week's lesson an abstract
noun by the addition of the proper suffix. Be able to distinguish
between the use of the qualifying adjective and the noun expressing
quality.
</p>

<p><b>Monday</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Stately</li>
<li>Forgetful</li>
<li>Real</li>
<li>Concise</li>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 18</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>Last week we finished the study of adverbs and we found that
they were a very important part of our vocabulary, and that most of us
needed a greater supply than we at present possess. This is true of both
adverbs and adjectives. While we do not use as many adverbs as
adjectives in our ordinary speech, nevertheless, adverbs are a very important
factor in expression. A great many adjectives can be readily turned
into adverbs. They are adjectives when they are used to describe a
noun, but by the addition of a suffix, they become adverbs used to
describe the action expressed by the verb. So in adding to our stock of
adjectives we also add adverbs to our vocabulary as well.
</p>

<p>Watch your speech this week and make a list of the adverbs which
you use most commonly, then go to your dictionary and see if you cannot
find synonyms for these adverbs. Try using these synonyms for
awhile and give the adverbs which you have been using for so long, a
well earned rest. Remember that our vocabulary, and the power to use
it, is like our muscles, it can only grow and develop by exercise.
</p>

<p>The best exercise which you can possibly find for this purpose is
conversation. We spend much more time in talking than in reading
or in writing. Conversation is an inexpensive pleasure and it does not
even require leisure always, for we can talk as we work; yet our
conversation can become a great source of inspiration and of influence as
well as a pleasant pastime. But do not spend your time in vapid and
unprofitable conversation. Surely there is some one in the list of your
acquaintances who would like to talk of things worth while. Hunt up
this some one and spend some portion of your day in profitable
conversation.
</p>

<p>Remember also that a limited vocabulary means also a limited
mental development. Did you ever stop to think that when we think
clearly we think in words? Our thinking capacity is limited, unless we
have the words to follow our ideas out to their logical conclusions.
</p>

<p>This matter of vocabulary is a matter, too, that is exceedingly
practical. It means success or failure to us in the work which we would
like to do in the world. A command of words means added power and
efficiency; it means the power to control, or at least affect, our
environment; it means the power over men and things; it means the difference
between being people of ability and influence and being obscure,
inefficient members of society.
</p>

<p>So feel when you are spending your time in increasing your vocabulary
that you are not only adding to your enjoyment of life but that
you are doing yourself the best practical turn; you are increasing your
efficiency in putting yourself in a position where you can make your
influence felt upon the people and circumstances about you. This effort
upon your part will bear practical fruit in your every day life.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_180" title="pg 180"></a>
A GROUP OF WORDS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_299">299.</b>  We have studied about the independent parts of speech, that
is, the nouns and pronouns and verbs. These are independent because
with them we can form sentences without the help of other words.
And these are the only three parts of speech which are so
independent&mdash;with
which we can form complete sentences. Then we have studied
also the words that modify,&mdash;that is, the words that are used with nouns
and pronouns and verbs to describe and explain more fully the ideas
which they express. So we have studied adjectives, which modify
nouns and pronouns; and adverbs, which modify verbs or adjectives
or other adverbs.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_300">300.</b>  The adjectives and adverbs which we have studied thus far
are single words; but we find that we may use little groups of words
in about the same way, to express the same idea which we have expressed
in the single adjective or adverb. For example, we may say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong men, <i>or</i>, men of strength.</li>
<li>City men, <i>or</i>, men from the city.</li>
<li>Jobless men, <i>or</i>, men without jobs.</li>
<li>Moneyed men, <i>or</i>, men with money.</li>
</ul>

<p>These groups of words like, <i>of strength</i>, <i>from the city</i>,
<i>without jobs</i>, and <i>with money</i>, express the same ideas that are expressed in the
single adjectives, <i>strong</i>, <i>city</i>, <i>jobless</i> and
<i>moneyed</i>.
</p>

<p>You recall that we defined any group of words used as a single
word as a <i>phrase</i>; so these groups of words are phrases which are
used as adjectives. The phrase, <i>of strength</i>, modifies the noun
<span class="corr" title="man"><i>men</i></span>, just as
the adjective <i>strong</i> modifies the noun <span class="corr" title="man"><i>men</i></span>. So we may call
these phrases which modify nouns, or which may be used to modify pronouns also,
<i>adjective phrases</i>, for they are groups of words used as adjectives.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Change the adjectives which are printed in italics in the following
sentences into phrases:</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Strong</i> men know no fear.</li>
<li>She bought a <i>Turkish</i> rug.</li>
<li>He followed the <i>river</i> bed.</li>
<li><i>Fashionable</i> women are parasites.</li>
<li>He left on his <i>homeward</i> journey.</li>
<li><i>Sensible</i> men readily understand their economic slavery.</li>
<li><i>Intelligent</i> people will not always submit to robbery.</li>
<li><i>Senseless</i> arguments cannot convince us of the truth.</li>
</ol>


<h3>USED AS ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_301">301.</b>  These phrases may be used in the place of single adverbs
also. You remember an adverb is a word that modifies a verb or an
adjective or another adverb. Let us see if we can not use a phrase or
a group of words in the place of a single adverb. For example:
</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_181" title="pg 181"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The man works rapidly, or, The man works with rapidity.</li>
<li>The man works now, or, The man works at this time.</li>
<li>The man works here, or, The man works at this place.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences <i>rapidly</i>, <i>now</i> and <i>here</i> are single
adverbs modifying the verb <i>work</i>. The phrases, <i>with rapidity</i>, <i>at this
time</i>, and <i>at this
place</i>, express practically the same ideas, conveyed by the single
adverbs, <i>rapidly</i>, <i>now</i> and <i>here</i>. These phrases modify the
verb in exactly the
same manner as the single adverbs. Therefore we call these groups of
words used as single adverbs, <i>adverb phrases</i>.
</p>

<p>We also use adverbs to modify adjectives. Let us see if we can use
adverb phrases in the same way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rockefeller is <i>excessively</i> rich; or, Rockefeller is rich <i>to excess</i>.</li>

<li>He is <i>bodily</i> perfect, but <i>mentally</i> weak; or, He is perfect
<i>in body</i> but weak <i>in mind</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the sentences above, the adverb <i>excessively</i> modifies the adjective
<i>rich</i>; the same meaning is expressed in the adverb phrase, <i>to excess</i>.
In the sentence, <i>He is bodily perfect, but mentally weak</i>, the adverb <i>bodily</i>
modifies the adjective <i>perfect</i> and the adverb <i>mentally</i> modifies the
adjective <i>weak</i>. In the last sentence, the same meaning is expressed by
the adverb phrases, <i>in body</i> and <i>in mind</i>. These phrases modify the
adjectives <i>perfect</i> and <i>weak</i>, just as do the single adverbs
<i>bodily</i> and <i>mentally</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_302">302.</b> We can use a phrase in the place of almost any adverb or
adjective. It very often happens, however, that there is no adjective
or adverb which we can use to exactly express our meaning and we are
forced to use a phrase. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He bought the large house <i>by the river</i>.</li>
<li>The man <i>on the train</i> is going <i>to the city</i>.</li>
<li>He came <i>from the country</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is impossible to find single words that express the meaning of
these phrases, <i>by the river</i>, <i>on the train</i>, <i>to the
city</i>, and <i>from the country</i>.
You could not say the <i>river house</i>; that is not what you mean. You
mean the large house <i>by the river</i>, yet the phrase <i>by the
river</i> modifies
and describes the house quite as much as the adjective <i>large</i>. It
is an adjective
phrase used to modify the noun <i>house</i>, yet it would be impossible
to express its meaning in a single word.

</ul>


<h3>PREPOSITIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_303">303.</b>  Have you noticed that all of these phrases, which we have
been studying and using as adjectives and adverbs, begin with a little
<span class="corr" title="work">word</span> like <i>of</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>at</i> or
<i>by</i>, which connects the phrase with the
word it modifies? We could scarcely express our meaning without these
little words. They are connecting words and fill an important function.
These words usually come first in the phrase. For this reason, they are
called <i>prepositions</i>, which means <i>to place before</i>.
</p>

<p>Let us see what a useful place these little words fill in our language.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_183" title="pg 183"></a>
Suppose we were watching the play of some boys outside our windows
and were reporting their hiding place. We might say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The boys are hiding <i>in</i> the bushes.</li>
<li>The boys are hiding <i>among</i> the bushes.</li>
<li>The boys are hiding <i>under</i> the bushes.</li>
<li>The boys are hiding <i>behind</i> the bushes.</li>
<li>The boys are hiding <i>beyond</i> the bushes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences are all alike except the prepositions <i>in</i>,
<i>among</i>, <i>under</i>, <i>behind</i> and <i>beyond</i>. If you read the sentences
and leave out these prepositions entirely, you will see that nobody could possibly
tell what connection the <i>bushes</i> had with the rest of the
sentence. The prepositions are necessary to express the relation of the word
<i>bushes</i> to the rest of the sentence.
</p>

<p>But this is not all. You can readily see that the use of a different
preposition changes the meaning of the sentence. It means quite a
different thing to say, <i>The boys are hiding in the bushes</i>, and to
say, <i>The boys are hiding beyond the bushes</i>. So the preposition has a great
deal to do with the true expression of our ideas.
</p>

<p>The noun <i>bushes</i> is used as the object of the preposition, and the
preposition shows the relation of its object to the word which it
modifies. You remember that nouns have the same form whether they are used
as subject or as object, but if you are using a pronoun after a
preposition, always use the object form of the pronoun. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I bought the book from <i>him</i>.</li>
<li>I took the message to <i>them</i>.</li>
<li>I found the place for <i>her</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the pronouns, <i>him</i>, <i>them</i>, and <i>her</i>
are used as objects of the prepositions <i>from</i>, <i>to</i> and <i>for</i>. So we
have used the object forms of these pronouns.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_304">304</b>. The noun or pronoun that follows the preposition, and is
used with it to make a phrase, is the object of the preposition. The
preposition is used to show the relation that exists between its object
and the word the object modifies. In the sentence above, <i>The boys
are hiding in the bushes</i>, the preposition <i>in</i> shows the
relationship between the verb phrase, <i>are hiding</i> and the object of the preposition,
<i>bushes</i>.
</p>

<p>The noun or pronoun which is the object of a preposition may also
have its modifiers. In the sentences used about the noun <i>bush</i>,
which is the object of the prepositions used, is modified by the adjective
<i>the</i>. Other modifiers might also be added, as for example:
</p>


<ul>
<li>The boys are hiding in the tall, thick bushes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The entire phrase, <i>in the tall, thick bushes</i>, is made up of the
preposition <i>in</i>, its object <i>bushes</i> and the modifiers of bushes,
<i>the</i>, <i>tall</i> and <i>thick</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_305">305</b>. The preposition, with its object and the modifiers of the
object, forms a phrase which we call a <i>prepositional phrase</i>. These
prepositional phrases may be used either as adjectives or as adverbs, so we
have our definitions:
</p>

<p><b>A preposition is a word that shows the relation of its object
to some other word.</b>
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_184" title="pg 184"></a>
<b>A phrase is a group of words used as a single word.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A prepositional phrase is a phrase composed of a preposition
and its object and modifiers.</b>
</p>

<p><b>An adjective phrase is a prepositional phrase used as an
adjective.</b>
</p>

<p><b>An adverb phrase is a prepositional phrase used as an adverb.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_306">306.</b> Here is a list of the most common and most important
prepositions. Use each one in a sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>above</li>
<li>about</li>
<li>across</li>
<li>after</li>
<li>against</li>
<li>along</li>
<li>around</li>
<li>among</li>
<li>at</li>
<li>before</li>
<li>behind</li>
<li>below</li>
<li>beneath</li>
<li>beside</li>
<li>between</li>
<li>beyond</li>
<li>by</li>
<li>down</li>
<li>for</li>
<li>from</li>
<li>in</li>
<li>into</li>
<li>of</li>
<li>off</li>
<li>over</li>
<li>to</li>
<li>toward</li>
<li>through</li>
<li>up</li>
<li>upon</li>
<li>under</li>
<li>with</li>
<li>within</li>
<li>without</li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERBS AND PREPOSITIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_307">307.</b> Many of the words that are used as prepositions are used
also as adverbs. It may be a little confusing to tell whether the word
is an adverb or a preposition, but if you will remember this simple rule
you will have no trouble:
</p>

<p><b>A preposition is always followed by either a noun or a pronoun
as its object, while an adverb never has an object.</b>
</p>

<p>So when you find a word, that can be used either as a preposition
or an adverb, used alone in a sentence without an object, it is an
adverb; but if it is followed by an object, then it is a preposition. This
brings again to our minds the fundamental rule which we have laid down, that
every word is classified according to the work which it does in a
sentence. The work of a preposition is to show the relation between its object
and the word which that object modifies. So whenever a word is used
in this way it is a preposition. For example: <i>He went about his
business.</i>
</p>

<p>Here, <i>about</i> is a preposition and <i>business</i> is its object.
But in the sentence, <i>He is able to be about</i>, <i>about</i> is used as an
adverb. It has no object.
</p>

<p><i>He sailed before the mast.</i> Here, <i>before</i> is a preposition
introducing the phrase <i>before the mast</i>, which modifies the verb
<i>sailed</i>. But in the
sentence, <i>I told you that before</i>, <i>before</i> is an adverb
modifying the verb <i>told</i>.
</p>

<p>By applying this rule you can always readily determine whether
the word in question is an adverb or a preposition.</p>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Tell whether the words printed in italics in the following sentences,
are prepositions or adverbs and the reason why:</p>

<ol>
<li>He came <i>across</i> the street.</li>
<li>He is <i>without</i> work.</li>
<li>Come <i>in</i>.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_185" title="pg 185"></a>
He lives <i>near</i>.</li>
<li>He brought it <i>for</i> me.</li>
<li>I cannot get <i>across</i>.</li>
<li>We will go <i>outside</i>.</li>
<li>This is <i>between</i> you and me.</li>
<li>He can go <i>without</i>.</li>
<li>Stay <i>in</i> the house.</li>
<li>Do not come <i>near</i> me.</li>
<li>They all went <i>aboard</i> at six o'clock.</li>
<li>He enlisted <i>in</i> the navy and sailed <i>before</i> the mast.</li>
<li>I do not know what lies <i>beyond</i>.</li>
<li>I will soon be <i>through</i>.</li>
<li>The aeroplane flew <i>above</i> the city for hours.</li>
</ol>


<h3>PHRASE PREPOSITIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_308">308.</b> Sometimes we have a preposition made up of several words
which we have used so commonly together that they are used as a single
word and we call the entire phrase a preposition. As, for example:
<i>According to</i>&mdash;<i>on account of</i>&mdash;<i>by means of</i>, etc.
</p>

<ol>
<li>He answered <i>according to</i> the rule.</li>
<li>I could not go <i>on account of</i> illness.</li>
<li>He won the election <i>by means of</i> fraud.</li>
<li>The strike was won <i>by help of</i> all the comrades.</li>
<li>You can learn to spell only <i>by dint of</i> memory.</li>
<li>We speak incorrectly <i>by force of</i> habit.</li>
<li>He went to New York <i>by way of</i> Chicago.</li>
<li>Ferrer died <i>for the sake of</i> his ideals.</li>
<li><i>In consideration of</i> this payment, we will send you the set of books.</li>
<li>Germany issued her ultimatum <i>in defiance of</i> the world.</li>
<li><i>In view of</i> all the facts, we are convinced of his innocence.</li>
<li>He will gladly suffer <i>in place of</i> his comrade.</li>
<li><i>In conformity with</i> the information contained in your letter,</li>
<li>I will join you on the 10th.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Mark the prepositions in the following quotation. In the first three
paragraphs the prepositional phrases are printed in italics. Determine
whether they are used as adjective phrases or as adverb phrases.
Underscore the prepositional phrases in the remainder of the quotation and
determine which word is used as the object of the preposition.

<blockquote>
<p class="center">THE SUNLIGHT LAY ACROSS MY BED</p>

<p><i>In the dark</i> one night I lay <i>upon my bed</i>. And <i>in the
dark</i> I dreamed a dream. I dreamed God took my soul <i>to Hell</i>.</p>

<p>And we came where hell opened <i>into a plain</i>, and a great house
stood there. Marble pillars upheld the roof, and white marble steps led up
<i>to it</i>. The wind <i>of heaven</i> blew <i>through it</i>. Only <i>at the
back</i> hung a thick curtain.
Fair men and women there feasted <i>at long tables</i>. They danced, and
I saw the robes <i>of women</i> flutter <i>in the air</i> and heard the laugh
<i>of strong men</i>. They
feasted <i>with wine</i>; they drew it <i>from large jars</i> which
stood somewhat <i>in the
background</i>, and I saw the wine sparkle as they drew it.</p>

<p>And I said <i>to God</i>, "I should like to go up and drink." And God said,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_186" title="pg 186"></a>
"Wait." And I saw men coming <i>into the banquet house</i>; they came in
<i>from The back</i> and lifted the corner <i>of the curtain</i> <i>at the
sides</i> and crept inquickly; and they let the curtain fall <i>behind them</i>; they bore great jars
they could hardly carry. And the men and women crowded <i>round them</i>, and the
newcomers opened their jars and gave them <i>of the wine</i> to drink; and I saw
that the women drank even more greedily than the men. And when others had
well drunken they set the jars <i>among the old ones</i> <i>beside the
wall</i>, and took their places <i>at the table</i>. And I saw that some <i>of the jars</i>
were very old and mildewed and dusty, but others had still drops <i>of new must</i> <i>on
them</i> and shone <i>from the furnace</i>.</p>

<p>And I said to God, "What is that?" For amid the sounds of the singing,
and over the dancing of feet, and over the laughing across the winecups,
I heard a cry.</p>

<p>And God said, "Stand away off."</p>

<p>And He took me where I saw both sides of the curtain. Behind the
house was a wine-press where the wine was made. I saw the grapes crushed,
and I heard them cry. I said, "Do not they on the other side hear it?"
</p>
<p>God said, "The curtain is thick; they are feasting."</p>

<p>And I said, "But the men who came in last. They saw?"</p>

<p>God said, "They let the curtain fall behind them&mdash;and they forgot!"</p>

<p>I said, "How came they by their jars of wine?"</p>

<p>God said, "In the treading of the press these are they who came to the
top; they have climbed out over the edge and filled their jars from below;
and have gone into the house."</p>

<p>And I said, "And if they had fallen as they climbed&mdash;?"</p>

<p>God said, "They had been wine."</p>

<p>I stood away off watching in the sunshine, and I shivered.</p>

<p>And after a while I looked, and I saw the curtain that hung behind the
house moving.</p>

<p>I said to God, "Is it a wind?"</p>

<p>God said, "A wind."</p>

<p>And it seemed to me that against the curtain I saw pressed the forms
of men and women. And after a while, the feasters saw it move, and they
whispered one to another. Then some rose and gathered the most worn-out
cups, and into them they put what was left at the bottom of other vessels.
Mothers whispered to their children, "Do not drink all, save a little drop when
you have drunk." And when they had collected all the dregs they slipped the
cups out under the bottom of the curtain without lifting it. After a while the
curtain left off moving.</p>

<p>I said to God, "How is it so quiet?"</p>

<p>He said, "They have gone away to drink it."</p>

<p>I said, "They drink it&mdash;their own!"</p>

<p>God said, "It comes from this side of the curtain, and they are very thirsty."</p>

<p>And still the feast went on.</p>

<p>Men and women sat at the tables quaffing great bowls. Some rose, and
threw their arms about each other and danced and sang. They pledged each
other in the wine, and kissed each other's blood-red lips.</p>

<p>Men drank till they could drink no longer, and laid their heads upon the
table, sleeping heavily. Women who could dance no more leaned back on the
benches with their heads against their lovers' shoulders. Little
children, sick with wine, lay down upon the edge of their mothers' robes.</p>

<p>I said, "I cannot see more, I am afraid of Hell. When I see men dancing
I hear the time beaten in with sobs; and their wine is living! Oh, I
cannot bear Hell!"</p>

<p>God said, "Where will you go?"</p>

<p>I said, "To the earth from which I came; it was better there."</p>

<p>And God laughed at me; and I wondered why He laughed.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Olive Schreiner.</i></span></p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 19</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this lesson we are completing our study of the preposition. The
preposition is one of the last parts of speech which we take up for
study and it is also one of the last parts of speech to be added to our
vocabulary. The child does not use the preposition when it first begins to talk.
It uses the names of things; words of action; words that describe
objects and actions. It does not begin to use prepositions until it begins
to relate ideas.
</p>

<p>The relation of ideas means that we are thinking; combining ideas
into thoughts. Then we begin to need prepositions, which are words
of relation, connecting words, expressing the relationship between
ideas. The measure of the fullness and richness of our lives is the measure of
our understanding of the world about us, of the relationship existing
between the different phases of that world and of our relationship to
it all.
</p>

<p>So words do not mean much to us until we can relate them to our
own lives and our own experiences. When you look up a word in the
dictionary, do not study the word alone; study also the thing for which
it stands. A person with a good memory might acquire a vocabulary
by sheer feat of memory; but what good would it do unless each word
could be related to practical experience? It is only in this way that
words become <i>alive</i> to us. We must have an idea, a concept and
knowledge of the thing for which the word stands.
</p>

<p>So let us use our dictionary in this way. Do not be satisfied when
you have looked up a word simply to know how to spell and pronounce
the word and understand somewhat of its meaning. Do not be satisfied
until it has become a live word to you. Have a clear image and
understanding of just what each word stands for. Use the words in sentences
of your own. Use them in your conversation. Make them a part of
your every-day life.
</p>

<p>Do not pass over any of the words in the lesson without understanding
their meaning. Study the poem <i>Abou Ben Adhem</i> in this week's
lesson. After you have read it over a number of times, close the book
and rewrite the poem in prose in your own language. Then compare
your version with the poem. Note where you have used different
expressions and decide which is the better, the words used in the poem
or your own words. Rewrite it several times until you have a
well-written version of this poem.
</p>

<p>Exercises such as this will increase your vocabulary and quickly
develop the power of expression. No power can come in any department
of life without effort having been expended in its acquisition. Our
great writers have been careful students. Robert Louis Stevenson says
that he has often spent a half a day searching for the particular word
which he needed to express precisely the idea in mind. Stevenson is a
master of the English and this power came to him by this sort of
studious and earnest work.

AN IMPORTANT WORD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_309">309.</b> Things are not always to be judged by their size. Sometimes
the most important things are very small and unimportant in appearance.
A great machine is before you. You see its giant wheels, its huge levers.
These may seem to be the most important parts of the machine, but here
and there throughout this great machine are little screws and bolts.
These bind the giant parts together. Without these connecting links,
the great wheels and levers and revolving belts could not work together.
Let a little bolt slip out of its place in the mechanism, and the great
wheels stop, the throbbing machinery comes to a standstill. No work
is possible until this little bolt has been replaced.
</p>

<p>So in our sentence building, the <i>preposition</i> is the bolt that joins
words together. The importance of the preposition in a language increases
just in proportion as the nation learns to think more exactly
and express itself more accurately.
</p>

<p>We found in our last lesson that by changing a preposition we can
change the entire meaning of the sentence. A man's life may depend
upon the use of a certain preposition. You may swear his life away by
bearing testimony to the fact whether you saw him <i>within</i> the house,
or <i>without</i> the house; or <i>before</i> dark, or <i>after</i> dark.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_310">310.</b> The preposition is an important word in the sentence. We
can use it to serve our purpose in various ways. We have found, for
instance, that we can use it:
</p>

<p><i>First</i>, to change an adjective into an adjective phrase. As, for
example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>fearless</i> man demands his rights.</li>
<li>The man <i>without fear</i> demands his rights.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Second</i>, to change an adverb into an adverb phrase. As, for
example:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to possess <i>peacefully</i> the fruits of our labor.</li>
<li>We want to possess <i>in peace</i> the fruits of our labor.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Third</i>, to express a meaning which we can express in no other way;
as, for example, <i>They are fighting for their country</i>. There is no
single word which we can use to express the meaning which we express in the
phrase, <i>for their country</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_311">311.</b> So the preposition has given us a new means of expression,
<i>the prepositional phrase</i>. We can, by its help, use a phrase in
place of an adjective to modify a noun or a pronoun, and in place of an adverb
to modify a verb or an adjective. And we can also use the prepositional
phrase to express relationship which we cannot express by a single
adjective or adverb.
</p>

<p>If I want to tell you that I see a bird in yonder tree, such an
expression
would be impossible without that little preposition <i>in</i>. By the
use of various prepositions, I can express to you the relationship
between the bird and the tree. I can tell you whether it is <i>under</i> the
tree, or <i>in</i> the tree, or <i>over</i> the tree, or flying <i>around</i>
the tree, or <i>near</i> the
tree. By the use of the various prepositions, I can express accurately
the relationship that exists between the <i>bird</i> and the
<i>tree</i>.
</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_191" title="pg 191"></a>
Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Look up the list of prepositions in Section 306, on page 184. Use
the following pairs of words in sentences and use as many different
prepositions as you can to express the different relationships which may
be <span class="corr" title="expresed">expressed</span> between these words. For example, take the
two words, <i>man</i> and <i>house</i>. You may say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man went <i>around</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>about</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>over</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>under</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>without</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>into</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>by</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>beyond</i> the house.</li>
<li>The man went <i>to</i> the house.</li></ul>


<table>
<tr><td>enemy</td> <td>city</td></tr>
<tr><td>soldiers</td> <td>cannon</td></tr>
<tr><td>man</td> <td>machine</td></tr>
<tr><td>woman</td> <td>factory</td></tr>
<tr><td>children</td> <td>school</td></tr>
<tr><td>government</td> <td>people</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>A GOVERNING WORD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_312">312.</b> The preposition shows the relation between two words. In
this way it enables us to use a noun or a pronoun as a modifying word.
For example, in the sentence given above, <i>I see the bird in the
tree</i>, the preposition <i>in</i> shows the relationship between <i>bird</i> and
<i>tree</i>, and makes
of <i>tree</i> a modifying word. It expresses a different meaning than
if we used the word <i>tree</i> as an adjective. For we do not mean that we
see a tree bird, but a bird in a tree. So with the help of the preposition
<i>in</i>, we have used <i>tree</i> as a modifying word.
</p>

<p>But the preposition <i>in</i> also governs the form of the word that
follows it. Since nouns have the same form whether they are used as subject
or object, this does not mean any change in the form of the nouns.
But pronouns have different forms for the subject and object, so when
we use a pronoun with a preposition, we must use the object form.
There are seven object forms of the personal pronouns, and after a
preposition, always use one of these object forms.
</p>

<ul>
<li>He gave it to <i>me</i>.</li>
<li>Give it to <i>him</i>.</li>
<li>Give it to <i>her</i>.</li>
<li>Add this to <i>it</i>.</li>
<li>Bring it to <i>us</i>.</li>
<li>I will give it to <i>you</i>.</li>
<li>He gave it to <i>them</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_313">313.</b> Be careful to always use the object form of the pronoun
following a preposition. Observe this also in the use of the relative
and interrogative pronoun "who." The object form is "whom." For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To whom will you go?</li>
<li>This is the man to whom I wrote.</li>
<li>For whom are you looking?</li>
<li>Where is the woman for whom you would make such a sacrifice?</li>
</ul>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_192" title="pg 192"></a>
Where to Put the Preposition</h4>

<p><b id="sec_314">314.</b> The preposition generally precedes its object. This is the
reason it was given its name, <i>preposition</i>, meaning <i>to place
before</i>. Sometimes,
however, the preposition is separated from its object. This is
often true when it is used with an interrogative or relative pronoun.
With these pronouns, the preposition is often thrown to the end of the
sentence. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the book about which I was speaking; <i>or</i>, This is the book
which I was speaking about.</li>

<li>To whom shall I give this letter; <i>or</i>, Who shall I give this
letter to?</li>
</ul>

<p>The sentence, <i>To whom shall I give this letter</i>, is grammatically
correct; but in ordinary usage we use the form, <i>Who shall I give this
letter to?</i>
</p>

<p>While the rule calls for the object form of the relative pronoun
after a preposition&mdash;so that the use of <i>to whom</i> is grammatically
correct&mdash;in
common usage we use the subject form of the pronoun when it is
used so far away from the preposition which governs it. So we find
this use common. For example, instead of saying, <i>For whom is this
letter?</i> we say, <i>Who is this letter for?</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_315">315.</b> In poetry also, we often find the object coming before the
preposition. For example:
</p>

<div class="poem left">
<p>"The interlacing boughs between</p>
<p>Shadows dark and sunlight sheen,</p>
<p>Alternate, come and go."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Boughs</i> is here the object of the preposition <i>between</i>, but
in this poetic expression the object is placed before the preposition. Note
also in the following:
</p>
<div class="poem left">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The unseen mermaid's pearly song,</p>
<p>Comes bubbling up the weeds <i>among</i>."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Forever panting and forever young,</p>
<p>All breathing human passion far <i>beyond</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><b id="sec_316">316.</b> After an interrogative adjective, the preposition is also
often thrown to the end of the sentence. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What men are the people talking <i>about</i>?</li>
<li>Which person did you write <i>to</i>?</li>
</ul>

<p>With these few exceptions, however, the preposition usually precedes
its object, as:</p>

<ul>
<li>We were astonished <i>at</i> the news.</li>
<li>He arose <i>from</i> his sleep.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_193" title="pg 193"></a>
POSSESSIVE PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_317">317.</b> Review Lesson 4, in which we studied the possessive use of
nouns. You will recall that we make the possessive form of the nouns
by the use of the apostrophe and <i>s</i>. But instead of using the
possessive forms of the name of inanimate things; that is, things without life, we
generally denote possession by the use of a phrase. Thus we would
say, <i>The arm of the chair</i>, instead of, <i>The chair's arm</i>;
or, <i>The roof of the house</i>, instead of, <i>The house's roof</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_318">318.</b> We also use a possessive phrase when the use of a possessive
form would give an awkward construction. As, for example: <i>Jesus'
sayings</i>. So many hissing sounds are not pleasant to the ear and so,
we say instead, <i>The sayings of Jesus</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_319">319.</b> We use a phrase also where both nouns are in the plural
form. In many words, there is no difference in the sound between a
single noun in the possessive form and a plural noun in the possessive
form. We can readily tell the meaning when it is written, because the
place of the apostrophe indicates the meaning, but when it is spoken
the sound is exactly the same. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The lady's hats.</li>
<li>The ladies' hats.</li>
</ul>

<p>Written out in this way, you know that in the first instance I am
speaking of the hats belonging to one lady, but in the second instance
of the hats belonging to two or more ladies. But when it is spoken,
you can not tell whether I mean one lady or a number of ladies. So
we use a phrase and say, <i>The hats of the lady</i>; or, <i>The hats of
the ladies</i>. Then the meaning is entirely clear.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_320">320.</b> Sometimes we want to use two possessives together, and in
this case it is better to change one of them into a phrase; for example,
<i>This is my comrade's father's book</i>. This is an awkward
construction. Say instead, <i>This is the book belonging to my comrade's father</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_321">321.</b> Do not overlook the fact, however, that the phrase beginning
with <i>of</i> does not always mean possession. Consider the following
examples and see if there is not a difference in meaning:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The history of Wilson is interesting.</li>
<li>Wilson's history is interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first instance, I mean the history of Wilson's life is
interesting; in the second instance I mean the history belongs to or written by
Wilson is interesting. So there is quite a difference in the meaning.
The phrase <i>of Wilson</i> used in the first example does not indicate
possession.
</p>

<p>Note the difference in meaning between the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The picture of Millet is good.</li>
<li class="linesp">Millet's picture is good.</li>

<li>The statue of Rodin stands in the park.</li>
<li>Rodin's statue stands in the park.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_194" title="pg 194"></a>
Would you say:</p>

<ul>
<li>The invention of gunpowder, or gunpowder's invention?</li>
<li>The destruction of Louvain, or Louvain's destruction?</li>
<li>The siege of Antwerp, or Antwerp's siege?</li>
<li>The boat's keel, or the keel of the boat?</li>
</ul>


<h3>COMMON ERRORS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_322">322.</b> Prepositions are usually very small and seemingly
unimportant words, yet we make a great many mistakes in their use. It is
these little mistakes that are most difficult to avoid.
</p>

<p>Notice carefully in your own speech this week, and in the conversation
which you overhear, the use of the prepositions. Notice especially
the following cautions:
</p>

<p><b>1. Do not use prepositions needlessly.</b> We often throw a
preposition in at the close of a sentence which we have already used in the
sentence, and which we should not use again. The little preposition
<i>at</i> is most frequently used in this way. See how many times this week you
hear people use such phrases as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>At which store do you trade at?</li>
<li>At what corner did you stop at?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last <i>at</i> is entirely unnecessary. It has already been used
once and that is enough. We also use <i>at</i> and <i>to</i> at the close of
sentences beginning with an interrogative adverb, where they are not necessary.
For example, we say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where did you go to?</li>
<li>Where did you stop at?</li>
<li>Where am I at?</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct form of these sentences is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you go?</li>
<li>Where did you stop?</li>
<li>Where am I?</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use <i>at</i> and <i>to</i> in this way, they are entirely
superfluous and
give a most disagreeable sound to the sentence. Do not close a sentence
with a preposition in this way.
</p>

<p><b>2. Do not omit the preposition where it properly belongs.</b>
For example, we often say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The idea is no use to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>We should say, <i>The idea is of no use to me.</i></p>

<ul>
<li>I was home yesterday.</li>
</ul>

<p>We should say, <i>I was at home</i> yesterday.</p>

<p><b>3. Do not use the preposition</b> <i>of</i> <b>with a verb that
requires an object.</b> The noun cannot be the object of both the verb and the
preposition. As, for example:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_195" title="pg 195"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>He does not remember <i>of</i> seeing you.</li>
<li>Do you approve <i>of</i> his action?</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Remember</i> and <i>approve</i> are both incomplete verbs requiring
an object, and the nouns <i>seeing</i> and <i>action</i> are the objects of the
incomplete verbs <i>remember</i> and <i>approve</i>. The preposition <i>of</i> is
entirely superfluous. The sentences should read:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He does not remember seeing you.</li>
<li>Do you approve his action?</li>
</ul>

<p>Other verbs with which we commonly use the preposition <i>of</i> in this
way are the verbs <i>accept</i> and <i>recollect</i>. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Will you accept <i>of</i> this kindness?</li>
<li>Will you try to recollect <i>of</i> it?</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences should read:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will you accept this kindness?</li>
<li>Will you try to recollect it?</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Correct Preposition</h4>

<p><b id="sec_323">323.</b>  We make a great many mistakes also in the choice of
prepositions. For example, the preposition <i>between</i> refers to two objects and
should never be used when you are speaking of more than two, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We settled the quarrel <i>between</i> the two men.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is correct, but it is incorrect to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>We settled the quarrel <i>between</i> the members of the Union.</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot settle a quarrel between a <i>dozen</i> people. When there
are more than two, use the word <i>among</i>. We can perhaps attempt to
settle a quarrel <i>among</i> a dozen people. <i>Between</i> refers to
two objects, <i>among</i> refers to more than two. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Divide the work <i>between</i> the two men.</li>
<li>Divide the work <i>among</i> twenty men.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_324">324.</b>  Do not confuse the use of <i>in</i> and <i>into</i>. When
entrance is denoted use <i>into</i>. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He came into the room.</li>
<li>He got into the auto.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often the use of <i>in</i> will give an entirely different meaning to
the sentence. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He ran <i>in</i> the water.</li>
<li>He ran <i>into</i> the water.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_196" title="pg 196"></a>
The man acted as our guide <i>in</i> the city.</li>
<li>The man acted as our guide <i>into</i> the city.</li>
<li>The horse ran <i>in</i> the pasture.</li>
<li>The horse ran <i>into</i> the pasture.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_325">325.</b> Do not use <i>below</i> and <i>under</i> to mean <i>less</i>
or <i>fewer</i> in regard
to an amount or number. <i>Below</i> and <i>under</i> have reference to
place only. It is correct to say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He went <i>under</i> the bridge.</li>
<li>He came out <i>below</i> the falls.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it is incorrect to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>The price is <i>below</i> cost.</li>
<li>There were <i>under</i> fifty present.</li>
</ul>

<p>Say instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>The price is <i>less</i> than cost.</li>
<li>There were <i>fewer</i> than fifty present.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_326">326.</b> Do not misuse <i>over</i> and <i>above</i>. These
prepositions have reference only to <i>place</i>. They are incorrectly used to mean
<i>more than</i> or <i>greater than</i>.
</p>

<p>It is correct to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>The boat anchored above the landing.</li>
<li>He flew over the city.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is incorrect to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>He bought above a hundred acres.</li>
<li>He lives over a mile from here.</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>He bought more than a hundred acres.</li>
<li>He lives more than a mile from here.</li>
</ul>


<h3>THE PREPOSITION WITH VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_327">327.</b> In our first lesson on prepositions, we had a list of verbs
and the correct preposition to use with these verbs. There are a few words
which we use very commonly in which the meaning is slightly different
according to the preposition which we use in connection with the verb.
Foreigners especially who are learning the English language have great
difficulty with the prepositions. Here are a few of these common words:
</p>

<p><b>Adapt.</b> With <i>adapt</i> we can use either the preposition
<i>to</i> or <i>for</i>.
For example; we adapt ourselves <i>to</i> circumstances, that is, we
accommodate
or conform ourselves; but a thing can be adapted <i>for</i> a certain
purpose.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_197" title="pg 197"></a>
<b>Agree.</b> We can use the prepositions <i>with</i> and <i>to</i> with
the verb <i>agree</i>, but with different meanings. For example, we say, We agree
<i>with</i> you about a certain matter; and, We agree <i>to</i> the
proposal which you make.
</p>

<p><b>Ask.</b> We ask a favor <i>of</i> a person. We ask a friend
<i>for</i> a favor.
We ask <i>about</i> some one or thing that we wish to hear about.
</p>

<p><b>Charge.</b> There are several prepositions we can use with the verb
<i>charge</i>. Your grocer charges you <i>for</i> the things that you
buy. If you run an account you are charged <i>with</i> a certain amount. These
things are charged <i>to</i> you; but in war the enemy charges <i>upon</i> you.
</p>

<p><b>Compare.</b> One thing is compared <i>with</i> another in quality,
but it is compared <i>to</i> another when we are using the comparison for an
illustration.
</p>

<p><b>Complain.</b> We make complaint <i>to</i> the manager <i>of</i> the
things we do not like.
</p>

<p><b>Comply.</b> We comply <i>with</i> the request of another, but he does
a thing <i>in</i> compliance <i>with</i> that request. Do not use the
preposition <i>to</i> with compliance.
</p>

<p><b>Correspond.</b> With correspond, we use either the preposition
<i>with</i> or <i>to</i>. For example, I may correspond <i>with</i> you, meaning
that I communicate with you by letter, but one thing corresponds <i>to</i> another, meaning
that it is like the other.
</p>

<p><b>Disgust.</b> We are disgusted <i>with</i> our friends sometimes
<i>at</i> the things
which they do. We are disgusted <i>with</i> people and <i>at</i> things.
</p>

<p><b>Reconcile.</b> With reconcile, we use either the preposition
<i>with</i> or <i>to</i>. For example, I may become reconciled <i>with</i> you; that
is, I am restored to friendship or favor after an estrangement. But we reconcile
one thing <i>to</i> another; that is, we harmonize one thing with another.
</p>

<p><b>Taste.</b> We have a taste <i>for</i> music, art or literature, but
we enjoy the taste <i>of</i> good things to eat. When taste refers to one of the
five senses, use the preposition <i>of</i>, but when you use it to mean
intellectual relish or enjoyment, use the preposition <i>for</i>.
</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 19</h2>


<p>There are a few prepositions which might really be called derivative
prepositions.</p>

<p>1. A few prepositions are formed from verbs. These are really
participle prepositions, for they are the present participles of the
verbs but have come to be used like prepositions. These are such as
<i>concerning</i>, <i>excepting</i>, <i>regarding</i>, <i>respecting</i>, <i>during</i>,
<i>according</i>, etc. Nearly all of
these participle prepositions can be expressed by a preposition phrase,
as for example, we can either say; I wrote <i>regarding</i> these facts,
or I wrote you <i>in regard to</i> these facts. I mentioned them all
<i>excepting</i> the last, or, I mentioned them all <i>with the exception of</i> the last. I
have gone <i>according</i> to the directions, or, I have gone <i>in accord
with</i> the directions.
</p>

<p>2. Derivative prepositions are also formed by prefixing <i>a</i> to
other parts of speech, as <i>along</i>, <i>around</i>, <i>abroad</i>, etc.
Strictly speaking these
might be called compound prepositions for the prefix <i>a</i> is really
from the preposition <i>on</i>.
</p>

<p>3. We have also compound prepositions formed:</p>

<p>By uniting two prepositions, as <i>into</i>, <i>within</i>,
<i>throughout</i>, etc.</p>

<p>By uniting a preposition and some other part of speech, usually a
noun or an adjective, as <i>beside</i>, <i>below</i> and <i>beyond</i>.</p>

<p>We also have a number of compound verbs which are made by
prefixing a preposition to a verb. Some of these compound words have
quite a different meaning from the meaning conveyed by the two words
used separately; as for example, the compound verb <i>withstand</i>,
derived from the preposition <i>with</i> and the verb <i>stand</i>, has almost
the opposite meaning from <i>stand with</i>.</p>

<p>Our spelling lesson this week includes a number of these compound
verbs formed by the use of the verb and a preposition. Look up the
meaning in the dictionary. Use them in sentences in the compound
form; then the two words separately as a verb and a preposition and
note the difference in the meaning.</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 20</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We are taking up in this lesson the study of the last important
part of speech. We have spent some little time on the study of these
parts of speech, but it has been time well spent. We cannot use good
English and construct sentences that express our thoughts without an
adequate knowledge of the words we use in sentence building. As soon
as we finish the study of the parts of speech, we will spend several
weeks in sentence building. This will give us a review of these lessons
in which we have studied separate words.
</p>

<p>The English language is one of the most interesting of all to study.
It is the most truly international of all languages, for the English
language contains words from almost every language in the world. Did
you ever stop to think that we could have internationalism in language
as well as in other things? We can be as narrowly patriotic concerning
words as concerning anything else.
</p>

<p>Nations have been prone to consider all those who do not speak
their language as barbarians. Germany, perhaps, possesses as strong
a nationalistic spirit as any country, and in Germany this spirit has
found expression in a society formed for the purpose of keeping all
foreign words out of the German language. They have published handbooks
of native words for almost every department of modern life.
They insist that the people use these words, instead of foreign importations.
The German State takes great pride in the German language
and considers it the most perfect of any spoken today. The rulers of
Germany believe that it is a part of their duty to the world to see that
all other nations speak the German language. In conquered Poland,
only German is permitted to be taught in the schools or to be spoken
as the language of commerce. The patriots in language seem to believe
that there is some connection between purity of language and purity of race.
</p>

<p>In English, however, we have the beginnings of an international
speech. Our civilization is derived from various sources. Here in
America we are truly the melting-pot of the nations, and this is mirrored
forth in our language which is, in a way, a melting-pot also, in
which have been thrown words from every tongue. Those for whom nationalism
is an important thing will probably cling to the idea of a
pure unmixed language, but to those of us to whom Internationalism is
not an empty word, but a living ideal, an international language becomes
also part of the ideal.
</p>

<p>There is a wealth of wonderful literature open to us once we have
gained a command of the English language. Pay especial attention to
the quotations given in each lesson. These are quotations from the very
best literature. If there are any of them that arouse your interest
and you would like to read more from the same author, write us and
we shall be glad to furnish you full information concerning further
reading.

<h3>CONJUNCTIONS<a class="pagenum" id="page_201" title="pg 201"></a></h3>

<p><b id="sec_328">328.</b> You remember that in Lesson 3, where we studied the parts
of speech, we found that we had another connective word besides the
preposition,&mdash;the conjunction.
</p>

<p>A preposition connects two words and shows what one of them has
to do with the other. The conjunction plays a different part as a
connective, for it connects not only words but also phrases and clauses.
Note the following sentences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shall we be men <i>or</i> machines?</li>
<li>We must struggle for ourselves <i>and</i> for our children.</li>
<li>We pray for peace <i>but</i> furnish ammunition for war.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of the conjunction saves a great deal of tiresome repetition,
for, by its use, where two subjects have the same predicate or two
predicates have the same subject, we can combine it all into one
sentence.
</p>

<p>You will readily realize how important this part of speech is to us.
If we did not have conjunctions our speech would be cumbersome and
we would have to use a great many short sentences and a great deal of
repetition. If we wanted to make the same statement concerning a
number of things, without conjunctions, we would have each time to
repeat the entire statement. Try to write a description of a scene and
avoid the use of conjunctions and you will see what an important part
these connective words play in our power of expression.
</p>

<p>Without the use of the conjunction, you would necessarily use a
great many short expressions and repeat the same words again and
again, and your description would be a jerky, tiresome, unsatisfactory
piece of writing.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Rewrite the following sentences, writing in separate sentences the
clauses that are united by the conjunctions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The birds are singing <i>and</i> spring is here.</li>
<li>We talk of peace, <i>but</i> war still rages.</li>
<li>The unemployed cannot find work <i>and</i> they are dying of hunger.</li>
<li>We believed in war for defense <i>and</i> every nation is now
fighting for defense.</li>
<li>We believe in education <i>and</i> we are struggling for universal education.</li>
<li>The old order is fast passing <i>and</i> the new order is rapidly appearing.</li>
<li>Profit is the keynote of the present, <i>but</i> service shall be the
keynote of the future.</li>
<li>All children should be in school, <i>but</i> thousands must earn
their bread.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that these sentences are made up of two or more simple
sentences combined; and each of these simple sentences is called a
clause, and each clause must contain a subject and a predicate.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Rewrite the following simple sentences, using conjunctions to
avoid a repetition of the same subject and predicate. Rewrite these into
a paragraph, making as well written a paragraph as you possibly can:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_202" title="pg 202"></a>
One hundred years ago the workers fought for universal education.</li>
<li>As a result we have our public schools of today.</li>
<li>Our public schools have been our chief bulwark against oppression.</li>
<li>Our public schools are our chief bulwark against oppression.</li>
<li>Our public schools are our greatest safeguard for the protection of
such liberty as we enjoy.</li>
<li>Our public school system embodies a socialistic ideal.</li>
<li>Our public school system is the most democratic of our institutions.</li>
<li>There has been a subtle subversion of the ideal.</li>
<li>The public school system has been made to serve the master class.</li>
<li>We have spent millions to make the ideal a reality.</li>
<li>Have we realized the ideal?</li>
<li>Is there universal education?</li>
<li>Is there education for every child beneath the flag?</li>
<li>The grounds of our public schools have cost millions.</li>
<li>The buildings have cost millions.</li>
<li>The courses of study are many.</li>
<li>They are varied.</li>
<li>They are elaborate.</li>
<li>But the workers of the world do not enjoy this feast.</li>
<li>The children of the workers do not enjoy this feast.</li>
</ul>


<h3>CLASSES OF CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_329">329.</b>  Conjunctions are divided into classes, as are other parts of
speech, according to the work which they do. Notice the following
sentences and notice how the use of a different conjunction changes
the meaning of the sentence.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We are united <i>and</i> we shall win.</li>
<li><i>When</i> we are united, we shall win.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence the conjunction <i>and</i> connects the two
clauses, <i>we are united</i> and <i>we shall win</i>. They are both independent
clauses, neither is dependent upon the other, and both are of equal importance.
But by the use of the conjunction <i>when</i>, instead of the
conjunction <i>and</i>,
we have changed the meaning of the sentence. There is quite a difference
in saying, <i>We are united and we shall win</i>, and <i>When we are
united we shall win</i>.
</p>

<p>By connecting these two statements with the conjunction <i>when</i>,
we have made of the clause, <i>we are united</i>, a dependent clause, it
modifies the verb phrase <i>shall win</i>. It tells <i>when</i> we shall win,
just as much as if we had used an <i>adverb</i> to modify the verb phrase, and had
said, <i>We shall win tomorrow</i>, instead of, <i>We shall win when we are
united</i>.
</p>

<p>So in these two sentences we have two different kinds of conjunctions,
the conjunction <i>and</i>, which connects clauses of equal rank or
order, and the conjunction <i>when</i>, which connects a dependent
clause to the principal clause.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_330">330.</b>  So the conjunctions like <i>and</i> are called co-ordinate
conjunctions. <i>Co-ordinate</i> means literally of equal rank or order. Conjunctions
like <i>when</i> are called sub-ordinate conjunctions.
<i>Sub-ordinate</i> means of inferior rank or order.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_203" title="pg 203"></a>
So we have our definitions:
</p>

<p><b id="sec_331">331.</b> <b>A conjunction is a word that connects words or phrases
or clauses.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A co-ordinate conjunction is one that joins words, phrases or
clauses having the same rank.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A subordinate conjunction is one that connects a dependent
clause to the principal clause.</b>
</p>

<h3>CO-ORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_332">332.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions connect words, phrases or
clauses of equal rank.</b> The most commonly used co-ordinate conjunctions
are; <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_333">333.</b> But there are a number of words which we often use as adverbs,
which may also be used as co-ordinate conjunctions. These words
are not always conjunctions, for they are sometimes used as adverbs.
When they are used as conjunctions they retain something of their adverbial
meaning; but still they are conjunctions, for they are used to
show the connection between two clauses of equal rank. Thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not in favor of the motion, <i>nevertheless</i> I shall vote for it.</li>
<li>The deputies voted for the war appropriation, <i>notwithstanding</i>
they had carried on an extensive anti-war propaganda.
</li>
<li>I did not believe in the change, <i>however</i> I did not oppose it.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_334">334.</b> The co-ordinate conjunctions which we use with this adverbial
meaning also, are; <i>therefore</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>still</i>,
<i>besides</i>, <i>consequently</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>likewise</i>,
<i>moreover</i>, <i>else</i>, <i>than</i>, <i>also</i>,
<i>accordingly</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, <i>notwithstanding</i>,
<i>otherwise</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>so</i> and <i>furthermore</i>.
</p>

<p>These conjunctions always refer to what has been said before and
serve to introduce and connect new statements.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_335">335.</b> We often use these conjunctions, and also, <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>or</i>, and
<i>nor</i>, at the beginning of a separate sentence or paragraph to connect it
in meaning with that which has gone before. You will often see the use
of these conjunctions as the first word of a new paragraph, thus relating
this paragraph to that which has preceded it.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_336">336.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions connect words of equal rank.</b></p>


<h3>NOUNS</h3>

<p>Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two or more <i>nouns</i> used as
the subject of a verb. As:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Death</i> and <i>disaster</i> follow in the wake of war.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>death</i> is just as much the subject of the verb <i>follow</i>
as is the word <i>disaster</i>, but no more so. You can omit either of these
words and the other will make a subject for the sentence. They are
<a class="pagenum" id="page_204" title="pg 204"></a>
both of equal importance, both of the same rank in the sentence, and
neither depends upon the other. These two words taken together
form the subject of the sentence. This is called the <i>compound subject</i>,
for it consists of two simple subjects.
</p>

<p>Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two or more nouns used as
the <i>object</i> of a verb.
</p>

<ul>
<li>He studies history and science.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence the words <i>history</i> and <i>science</i> are both
used as objects of the verb <i>studies</i>.</p>

<p>Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two or more nouns used as
the object of a <i>preposition</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>He called for the letters and the papers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence <i>letters</i> and <i>papers</i> are both objects of
the preposition <i>for</i>, connected by the co-ordinate conjunction <i>and</i>.</p>


<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Note in the following sentences the nouns which are connected by
conjunctions and decide whether they are used as the subject of the
sentences or the object of verbs or of prepositions. Draw a line under
compound subjects.
</p>
<ol>
<li>John and Henry are going home.</li>
<li>Music and painting are fine arts.</li>
<li>The grounds and buildings of our public schools have cost millions.</li>
<li>The time calls for brave men and women.</li>
<li>We struggle for truth and freedom.</li>
<li>Will you study English or arithmetic?</li>
<li>Education and organization are necessary for success.</li>
<li>We must learn the truth about production and distribution.</li>
<li>We demand justice and liberty.</li>
<li>The great struggle is between the working class and the ruling class.</li>
</ol>


<h3>PRONOUNS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_337">337.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions may also connect pronouns.</b></p>

<p>These are used in the same way as nouns,&mdash;either as subject or
object. Nouns have the same form whether used as subject or object.
Pronouns, however, have different forms when used as the object.
Here is where we often make mistakes in the use of pronouns. When the
pronouns are connected by co-ordinate conjunctions they are of the same
rank and are used in the same construction;&mdash;if they are used as subjects
both must be used in the subject form;&mdash;if they are used as objects,
both must be used in the object form. For example, it is incorrect
to say, <i>He told the story to her and I</i>. Here <i>her</i> is properly used in
the object form, for it is the object of the preposition <i>to</i>; the pronoun <i>I</i>
connected with <i>her</i> by the use of the conjunction <i>and</i> is also the object
of the preposition <i>to</i>, and the object form should be used. You would
not say, <i>He told the story to I</i>. The sentence should read, <i>He told the
story to her and me</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_205" title="pg 205"></a>
Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two pronouns used as the
<i>subject</i> of a sentence, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>She</i> and <i>I</i> arrived today.</li>
</ul>

<p>Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two pronouns used as the
<i>object</i> of the verb, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you call <i>her</i> or <i>me</i>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Co-ordinate conjunctions may connect two pronouns used as the
object of the <i>preposition</i>, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He gave that to <i>you</i> and <i>me</i>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Study closely the following sentences and correct those in which
the wrong form of the pronoun is used.</p>

<ol>
<li>He and I are old friends.</li>
<li>Did you ask him or me?</li>
<li>They promised him and I that they would come.</li>
<li>Find the place for she and me.</li>
<li>Me and him will get it for you and she.</li>
<li>She and I will go with you.</li>
<li>You and I must decide matters for ourselves.</li>
<li>You will find him and her to be loyal comrades.</li>
</ol>


<h3>VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_338">338.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions are also used to connect
verbs.</b> Verbs connected in this way have the same subject; and with the use
of the conjunction to connect the verbs, we save repeating the subject.
</p>
<ul>
<li>He <i>reads</i> and <i>studies</i> constantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence <i>reads</i> and <i>studies</i> are words of the same
kind and of the same rank; either could be omitted and the other would make a
predicate for the sentence. They are of equal importance in the sentence
and are connected by the conjunction <i>and</i>. They have a single
subject, the pronoun <i>he</i>.
</p>

<p>This is called a compound predicate.</p>

<p>In the sentence, <i>He reads constantly</i>, we have a simple predicate,
the single verb <i>reads</i>; but in the sentence, <i>He reads and
studies constantly</i>, we have a compound predicate, compound of the two verbs <i>reads</i>
and <i>studies</i>. A sentence may have both a compound subject and a
compound predicate. As, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>John and James read and study constantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence <i>John</i> and <i>James</i> is the compound subject of
both the verbs, <i>read</i> and <i>study</i>. So we have a compound subject and a
compound predicate.
</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_206" title="pg 206"></a>
Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Notice the verbs in the following sentences connected by co-ordinate
conjunctions. Draw lines under each compound predicate.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The days come <i>and</i> go in a ceaseless round.</li>
<li>The brave man dreams <i>and</i> dares to live the dream.</li>
<li>The coward dreams <i>but</i> dares not live the dream.</li>
<li>We produce splendidly <i>but</i> distribute miserably.</li>
<li>The bought press twists <i>and</i> distorts the facts.</li>
<li>Only a traitor aids <i>or</i> supports the enemy.</li>
<li>We agitate <i>and</i> educate for the cause of liberty.</li>
</ol>


<h3>ADJECTIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_339">339.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions are used to connect
adjectives.</b>
</p>

<p>In this way we use a number of adjectives to modify the same word
without tiresome repetition. When several adjectives are used to modify
the same word, the conjunction is used only between the last two
adjectives. As, for example:
</p>

<p>A <i>simple</i>, <i>clear</i> and <i>concise</i> course has been
prepared.</p>



<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, underscore the adjectives which are
connected by co-ordinate conjunctions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The plains of France are covered with the dead and dying soldiers.</li>
<li>Education should be both universal and free.</li>
<li>They are faithful and loyal comrades.</li>
<li>This was only our just and legal right.</li>
<li>Old and hoary was the man who sat on the stool by the fireless and godless altar.</li>
<li>The service of humanity is a sweet and noble task.</li>
<li>We must be brave and true.</li>
<li>He lived a noble and courageous life.</li>
<li>All was old and cold and mournful.</li>
<li>Most powerful and eloquent is the voice of the disinherited.</li>
</ol>


<h3>ADVERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_340">340.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions are also used to connect
adverbs.</b> This gives us the power to describe the action expressed in verbs
without the tiresome repetition of the verb. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He spoke <i>fluently</i> and <i>eloquently</i>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 7</h4>

<p>In the following sentences underscore the adverbs which are connected
by co-ordinate conjunctions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Man selfishly and greedily prevents his fellow men from the
enjoyment of nature's bounties.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_207" title="pg 207"></a>
She is wonderfully and gloriously brave.</li>
<li>He speaks eloquently and impressively, but very slowly.</li>
<li>Nature has provided lavishly and bountifully for her children.</li>
<li>Advice spoken truly and wisely is always in season.</li>
<li>We must resist injustice bravely and courageously.</li>
<li>He feels keenly and deeply <span class="corr" title="and">the</span> wrongs of his class.</li>
<li>He writes easily and rapidly.</li>
<li>The words, calmly and coolly spoken, were instantly opposed.</li>
<li>He reached that conclusion naturally and inevitably.</li>
<li>He was gently but unwaveringly firm.</li>
<li>The revolution comes slowly but surely.</li>
</ol>


<h3>PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_341">341.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions are used, not only to connect
words, but also to connect phrases.</b></p>


<h4>Verb Phrases</h4>

<p><b id="sec_342">342.</b> Verb phrases may be connected by conjunctions. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The People's College <i>is owned</i> and <i>controlled</i> by the
working class.</li>
<li>We <i>have made</i> and <i>are making</i> a fierce struggle for a free
press.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this last sentence the two verb phrases, <i>have made</i> and <i>are
making</i> are connected by the co-ordinate conjunction <i>and</i>. Often in using
verb phrases, we use phrases in which the same helping verb occurs in
both phrases. When this is the case the helping verb is quite often
omitted in the second phrase and only the participle is connected by the
conjunction. As, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The People's College is owned and controlled by the working class.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence the helping verb <i>is</i> belongs in both the phrases
but is omitted in the second phrase in order to make a smoother sounding
sentence. In the second phrase, only the past participle
<i>controlled</i> is used. It is understood that we mean,
</p>

<p>The People's College <i>is owned</i> and <i>is controlled</i> by the
working class.</p>

<h4>Exercise 8</h4>

<p>Note the use of the conjunction in the following sentences to connect
the verb phrases. Supply the helping verb where it is omitted.</p>

<li>Our system of education is rooted and grounded in outgrown dogmas.</li>
<li>We have written but have received no answer.</li>

<h3>CLAUSES<a class="pagenum" id="page_209" title="pg 209"></a></h3>

<p><b id="sec_345">345.</b> <b>Co-ordinate conjunctions are also used to connect clauses
of equal rank.</b>  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>The floods came and the winds blew.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these clauses is a complete sentence in itself, but they are
combined into one compound sentence by the use of the co-ordinate
conjunction, <i>and</i>. Clauses united in this way may have a compound
subject and a compound predicate, but two complete clauses must be
united by a co-ordinate conjunction in order to form a compound
sentence. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The rain and snow fell, <i>and</i> the wind blew a mighty gale.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the first clause in the compound sentence, <i>the rain and snow
fell</i>, contains a compound subject, <i>rain and snow</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The boys are running and shouting, <i>and</i> the girls are gathering
flowers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the first clause has a compound predicate, <i>are running</i> and
<i>shouting</i>. The second <i>and</i> connects the two clauses forming
the compound sentence.
</p>

<h3>CORRELATIVES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_346">346.</b> Certain co-ordinate conjunctions are used in pairs, such as
<i>both, and</i>; <i>either, or</i>; <i>neither, nor</i>; <i>whether,
or</i>. These pairs are called correlatives. The first word in the pair, as, <i>both</i>,
<i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, or
<i>whether</i>, is used as an assistant conjunction helping the other to
do the connecting. These are used in such sentences as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I have <i>both</i> seen <i>and</i> heard him.</li>
<li>They will join us <i>either</i> in April <i>or</i> in May.</li>
<li>Labor has received <i>neither</i> liberty <i>nor</i> justice.</li>
<li><i>Whether</i> to go forward <i>or</i> to retreat was the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <i>nor</i> is always the proper correlative to use with
<i>neither</i> and also with the negatives <i>not</i> and <i>never</i> when they apply
to what follows as well as to what precedes. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>There are thousands in this country who can <i>neither</i> read
<i>nor</i> write.</li>
<li><i>Neither</i> you <i>nor</i> I can foretell the future.</li>
<li>He will <i>not</i> write <i>nor</i> should you.</li>
<li>Capital punishment is <i>nothing</i> more <i>nor</i> less than legalized
murder.</li>
<li>We shall <i>never</i> lower our colors <i>nor</i> retreat.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Or</i> is always used with the correlative <i>either</i>. For
example:</p>

<ul>
<li>We will <i>either</i> come <i>or</i> write you.</li>
<li><i>Either</i> he was mistaken <i>or</i> he deliberately lied.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_210" title="pg 210"></a>
Exercise 11</h4>

<p>Note the use of the co-ordinate conjunctions <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>,
<i>or</i> and <i>nor</i>,
in the following quotation. Mark especially the use of <i>and</i> as an
introductory conjunction, introducing a new sentence, but connecting it with
that which has gone before.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my judgment slavery is the child of ignorance. Liberty is born of
intelligence. Only a few years ago there was a great awakening in the human
mind. Men began to inquire, "By what right does a crowned robber make me
work for him?" The man who asked this question was called a traitor.
</p>

<p>They said then, and they say now, that it is dangerous for the mind of man
to be free. I deny it. Out on the intellectual sea there is room for every
sail. In the intellectual air, there is space enough for every wing. And the
man who does not do his own thinking is a slave, and does not do his duty to
his fellow men. For one, I expect to do my own thinking. And I will take
my oath this minute that I will express what thoughts I have, honestly and
sincerely. I am the slave of no man and of no organization. I stand under
the blue sky and the stars, under the infinite flag of nature, the peer of every
human being.
</p>

<p>All I claim, all I plead is simple liberty of thought. That is all. I do
not pretend to tell what is true nor all the truth. I do not claim that I have
floated level with the heights of thought, nor that I have descended to the
depths of things; I simply claim that what ideas I have, I have a right to
express, and any man that denies it to me is an intellectual thief and robber.
</p>

<p>Every creed that we have today has upon it the mark of the whip or the
chain or the fagot. I do not want it. Free labor will give us wealth, and has
given us wealth, and why? Because a free brain goes into partnership with
a free hand. That is why. And when a man works for his wife and children,
the problem of liberty is, how to do the most work in the shortest space of
time; but the problem of slavery is, how to do the least work in the longest
space of time. Slavery is poverty; liberty is wealth.
</p>

<p>It is the same in thought. Free thought will give us truth; and the man
who is not in favor of free thought occupies the same relation to those he
can govern that the slaveholder occupied to his slaves, exactly. Free thought
will give us wealth. There has not been a generation of free thought yet. It
will be time to write a creed when there have been a few generations of free-brained
men and splendid women in this world. I don't know what the future
may bring forth; I don't know what inventions are in the brain of the future;
I don't know what garments may be woven, with the years to come; but I do
know, coming from the infinite sea of the future, there will never touch this
"bank and shoal of time" a greater blessing nor a grander glory, than liberty
for man, woman and child.
</p>

<p>Oh, liberty! Float not forever in the far horizon! Remain not forever in
the dream of the enthusiast and the poet and the philanthropist. But come and
take up thine abode with the children of men forever.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>Ingersoll.</i></span>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 20</h2>

<p>We found that we often formed adjectives by adding suffixes to
other words. We also form many adverbs by the addition of suffixes to
other words. Derivative adverbs are formed in the following ways:
</p>

<p>1. By adding suffixes to adjectives, chiefly the suffix <i>ly</i>, as for
example; <i>chiefly</i>, <i>truly</i>, <i>really</i>, <i>lately</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>2. By changing <i>ble</i> to <i>bly</i>, as in <i>ably</i>,
<i>nobly</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>3. By adding the suffix <i>ward</i>, as in <i>forward</i>,
<i>upward</i>, <i>skyward</i>, <i>downward</i>, <i>homeward</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>4. We have some adverbs formed by adding the prefix <i>a</i> to adjectives
and nouns, as <i>ahead</i>, <i>afoot</i>, <i>afresh</i>, also by adding
the prefix <i>be</i>, as in <i>besides</i>, <i>beyond</i>.
</p>

<p>We often misspell a number of adverbs by adding <i>s</i> where it does
not rightfully belong; as, <i>anywheres</i>, <i>everywheres</i>,
<i>backwards</i>, <i>forwards</i>,
<i>towards</i>, <i>upwards</i>, <i>downwards</i>, <i>afterwards</i>,
<i>homewards</i>, etc. All of these
words should be written without the <i>s</i>.
</p>

<p>We also have a number of compound adverbs which are made by
the union of two other parts of speech, such as <i>sometime</i>,
<i>henceforth</i>, <i>forever</i>, <i>overheard</i>, <i>outside</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>In the lesson for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, adjectives are
given having opposite meanings. Make the proper adverbs from these
adjectives by the addition of the suffix <i>ly</i>.
</p>

<p>Thursday's and Friday's lessons are made up of both adjectives
and adverbs that end in <i>ly</i>. Look up in your dictionary and be
sure you know which are adjectives and which are adverbs.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 21</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this lesson we are completing the study of conjunctions. We
have studied the conjunction last among the parts of speech and in the
order of the development of language, the conjunction naturally comes
last. The need of connective words does not come in any language
until the language is quite well developed. You will notice that the connective
words, such as prepositions and conjunctions are the last words
the child begins to use. The child first begins to use the names of the
things with which it comes in contact, then it learns the words that express
what these things do. But it is not until the child begins to reason
that it begins to use connective words. These become necessary when
we have reached a stage of development where we can consider the
relationship existing between things.
</p>

<p>The use of conjunctions, however, can be greatly overdone. The
long and involved sentences are more difficult to understand. If you
will note the authors which you enjoy the most, it will probably be those
who use short and crisp sentences. We have some authors who by the
use of conjunctions can string one sentence out over several pages.
You wonder how they manage to exist so long without stopping for
breath. It is very easy for us to fall into this error when we are thinking
rapidly and our thoughts all seem to be closely connected. But no
mind can grasp many ideas at one time. Break your sentences up
and express your ideas concisely and clearly. Use conjunctions rather
sparingly, especially these subordinate conjunctions. Do not have too
many subordinate clauses in one sentence.
</p>

<p>Notice in your reading for this week those who use the short, crisp
sentences and those who use the longer and more involved sentences.
Notice which are understood more readily and which are more enjoyable
to read. Take some of the paragraphs from those who write long
and involved sentences and break them up into short sentences and see
if these shorter sentences do not make the meaning simpler and clearer.
This will be excellent practice also in gaining the power of expression.
</p>

<p>Especially in the class struggle do we need those who can write
clearly and simply of the great problems of the day. As the work of the
world is conducted today, the workers have too little time for reading.
They are apt, after a hard day's work, to be too tired to follow an author
through long, winding, involved passages.
</p>

<p>In the spoken word, this is also true. You will find your hearers
much more in sympathy with you if you will use short sentences. Break
your thought up so they can readily grasp your meaning and follow you
to your conclusion.
</p>

<p>Conjunctions are very important to save us from tiresome repetitions
and short, jerky sentences, but we must avoid using them too frequently.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_213" title="pg 213"></a>
SUBORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_347">347.</b> We have found that co-ordinate conjunctions connect words,
phrases and also clauses that are entirely independent; that is, they do
not depend in the slightest degree upon any other word, phrase or
clause. Subordinate conjunctions connect inferior clauses to the main clauses
of the sentence. These inferior clauses are dependent clauses.
Subordinate conjunctions never connect words or phrases; but only dependent
clauses, to the rest of the sentence. Note the following sentences:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He came <i>quickly</i>.</li>
<li>He came <i>on time</i>.</li>
<li>He came <i>when he was called</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence the word <i>quickly</i> is an adverb modifying the
verb <i>came</i> and answers the question <i>when</i>. It tells
<i>when</i> he came. In
the second sentence, the phrase <i>on time</i> is an adverb phrase modifying
the verb <i>came</i>, and answers the question <i>when</i>. It tells
<i>when</i> he came. In the third sentence, the clause <i>when he was called</i>, also
answers the question <i>when</i>, and tells <i>when</i> he came. Therefore, it is a
clause used as an adverb. It is different from the phrase <i>on time</i>, for the
phrase <i>on time</i> does not contain a subject and a predicate.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_348">348.</b> The difference between the phrase and the clause is that the
phrase does not contain either a subject or a predicate, while the
clause <i>always</i> contains both a subject and a predicate. So in the clause,
<i>when he was called</i>, <i>he</i> is the subject and <i>was called</i> is the
predicate, and <i>when</i>
is the subordinate conjunction, which connects this adverb clause to
the verb <i>came</i>, which it modifies. The clause <i>he came</i>, and
the clause <i>when he was called</i>, are not of equal rank and importance, because
the clause, <i>when he was called</i>, simply modifies the verb contained in
the clause <i>he came</i>, by describing the <i>time</i> of the action
expressed in the verb
<i>came</i>. So the clause, <i>when he was called</i>, is a subordinate
or dependent clause, and the conjunctions which connect this class of clauses to the
main clause are called subordinate conjunctions.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_349">349.</b> <b>A subordinate conjunction is one that connects a
dependent clause to the principal clause.</b>
</p>

<h3>CLASSES OF SUBORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_350">350.</b> Most subordinate conjunctions are used to make adverb
clauses. These clauses will answer some one of the questions answered
by adverbs. They will tell <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i> or
<i>why</i> the action expressed
in the verb in the principal clause occurred. There are six classes of
these subordinate conjunctions which are used to introduce adverb
clauses. They introduce:
</p>

<p><b id="sec_351">351.</b> <b>Adverb clause of time.</b> These clauses will answer the
question <i>when</i> and are introduced by such subordinate conjunctions as,
<i>before</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>when</i>,
<i>after</i> and <i>as soon as</i>. Notice in the
following sentences the difference made in the meaning of the sentences
by the use of the different conjunctions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_214" title="pg 214"></a>
We waited <i>until</i> you came.</li>
<li>We waited <i>after</i> you came.</li>
<li>We waited <i>as</i> you came.</li>
<li>We waited <i>before</i> you came.</li>
<li>We waited <i>since</i> you came.</li>
<li>We left <i>while</i> you were gone.</li>
<li>We left <i>when</i> you were gone.</li>
<li>We left <i>as soon as</i> you were gone.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_352">352.</b> <b>Adverb clause of place.</b> These answer the question
<i>where</i>, and are introduced by the conjunctions, <i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>,
<i>whither</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will go <i>where</i> you go.</li>
<li>The wind blows <i>whither</i> it listeth.</li>
<li>He went <i>whence</i> he came.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_353">353.</b> <b>Adverb clauses expressing cause or reason.</b>  These
will answer the question <i>why</i>. They are introduced by such subordinate
conjunctions as, <i>because</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>whereas</i>,
<i>inasmuch as</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>Note the difference in the meaning of the following sentences expressed
by the use of different conjunctions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I will come <i>because</i> you expect me.</li>
<li>I will come <i>since</i> you expect me.</li>
<li>I will come <i>as</i> you expect me.</li>
<li>I will come <i>for</i> you expect me.</li>
<li>I will come <i>inasmuch as</i> you expect me.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_354">354.</b> <b>Adverb clauses of manner.</b> These clauses will answer
the question <i>how</i>, and are introduced by such subordinate conjunctions
as, <i>as</i>, <i>as if</i>, <i>as though</i>, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Study <i>as though</i> you were in earnest.</li>
<li>Come <i>as if</i> you had been called.</li>
<li>Do <i>as</i> I say, not <i>as</i> I do.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these clauses of <i>manner</i>, introduced by <i>as if</i>, and <i>as
though</i>, <i>were</i> is used in the present form with either singular or plural subjects.
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>He writes as if he <i>were</i> informed of the facts.</li>
<li>They talk as though they <i>were</i> confident of success.</li>
<li>You act as though I <i>were</i> your slave.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_355">355.</b> <b>Adverb clauses of comparison.</b>  These clauses are introduced
by the subordinate conjunctions <i>than</i> and <i>as</i>. The verbs are often
omitted in these dependent clauses introduced by <i>than</i> and <i>as</i>. For
example: <i>He is taller than I.</i> The complete sentence would be: <i>He is
taller than I am.</i> <i>He is not so tall as I.</i> Here the sentence would be:
<i>He is not so tall as I am.</i>
</p>

<p>When the pronoun occurs in these dependent clauses, be sure to
use the proper form of the pronoun. It may be the subject or the object
of the verb which is not expressed. For example; it is incorrect to say:
<a class="pagenum" id="page_215" title="pg 215"></a>
<i>I am not so tall as him.</i> The correct form is: <i>I am not so tall
as he.</i> The complete sentence would be: <i>I am not so tall as he is</i>, and the
pronoun should be in the subject form, for it is the subject of the verb
<i>is</i>, which is understood and omitted.
</p>

<p>The use of the <i>subject</i> or of the <i>object</i> form may make a difference
in the meaning of your sentence. For example, you say: <i>I admire them
as much as he.</i> You mean that you admire them as much as he admires
them. But if you say, <i>I admire them as much as him</i>, you mean that
you admire them as much as you admire him. Quite a different meaning!
</p>

<p>Be careful in the use of your pronouns in this way, for you can
express quite a different meaning. For example, if you say, <i>I care more
for you than he</i>, you mean, I care more for you than he cares for you.
But if you say, <i>I care more for you than him</i>, you mean, I care more for
you than I care for him. A mistake like this might mean a great deal
to you some time, if the one to whom you had been speaking had been
studying a course in Plain English!
</p>

<p><b id="sec_356">356.</b> <b>Adverb clauses of condition.</b> These clauses are introduced
by such conjunctions as, <i>if</i>, <i>provided</i>, <i>supposing</i>,
<i>unless</i>, <i>except</i>,
<i>otherwise</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>notwithstanding</i>, <i>albeit</i>,
and <i>whether</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I will come <i>if</i> you need me.</li>
<li>I will come <i>provided</i> you need me.</li>
<li>I will go <i>notwithstanding</i> you need me.</li>
<li>I will not go <i>unless</i> I am called.</li>
<li>He will not go <i>except</i> he is called.</li>
<li>He will not go <i>though</i> he is called.</li>
<li>He came, <i>otherwise</i> I would go.</li>
<li>He will go <i>whether</i> you go or stay.</li>
</ul>

<p>When subordinate clauses beginning with <i>if</i>, <i>though</i> or
<i>unless</i> are
joined to clauses containing <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i> or
<i>should</i>, the verb <i>were</i>
is sometimes used with a singular subject, in such sentences as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If this <i>were</i> true, I should know it.</li>
<li>Unless I <i>were</i> positive, I would not say so.</li>
<li>Though our leader <i>were</i> lost, yet we would not despair.</li>
<li>If he <i>were</i> here, he would explain it himself.</li>
<li>If I <i>were</i> with you, I might make you understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes in sentences like these, <i>if</i> is omitted in the clause,
and the verb placed first. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Were</i> he here, he would deny these slanders.</li>
<li><i>Were</i> he truly class-conscious, he would oppose this war.</li>
<li><i>Were</i> this fact known, the people would never submit.</li>
</ul>

<p>These clauses express something which is uncertain, or which is to
be decided in the future; a supposition contrary to a fact or a wish.
Occasionally you will find the verb <i>be</i> used instead of <i>is</i>,
in clauses of this kind introduced by <i>if</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>unless</i>,
<i>except</i>, <i>lest</i>, etc. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If it <i>be</i> true, I will hear it.</li>
<li>Though he <i>be</i> guilty, we will not desert him.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_216" title="pg 216"></a>
In subordinate clauses connected by <i>if</i>, <i>unless</i>, etc., with
a principal clause which expresses future time, the present form of the verb is used
in the subordinate clause. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If they are willing, we will join them.</li>
<li>Unless he comes, I shall not leave.</li>
<li>If it rains, we will not go.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_357">357.</b> <b>Adverb clauses expressing purpose.</b> These are introduced
by such subordinate conjunctions as, <i>that</i>, <i>in order that</i>
and <i>lest</i>. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Take good care <i>that</i> you understand this lesson.</li>
<li>I will go today <i>in order that</i> I may meet him.</li>
<li>Watch these carefully <i>lest</i> they be stolen.</li>
<li>Read the labor press <i>that</i> you may know the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that <i>that</i>, when used in this way, as a pure conjunction,
means <i>in order that</i>. For example, the sentence above might read:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the labor press <i>in order that</i> you may know the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_358">358.</b> <b>Adverb clauses expressing result.</b> These are
introduced by the subordinate conjunction <i>that</i>, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>They were so late <i>that</i> I could not go.</li>
</ul>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p><b id="sec_359">359.</b> We have then adverb clauses introduced by subordinate
conjunctions expressing:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Time.</b> Answer the question <i>when</i>.</li>
<li><b>Place.</b> Answer the question <i>where</i>.</li>
<li><b>Cause or reason.</b>  Answer the question <i>why</i>.</li>
<li><b>Manner.</b>  Answer the question <i>how</i>.</li>
<li><b>Comparison.</b>  Used to compare.</li>
<li><b>Condition.</b>  Answer the question <i>on what condition</i>.</li>

<h3>PHRASE CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_360">360.</b> There are certain phrases which have come to be used together
as conjunctions so commonly that we may consider them as conjunctions.
They are:
</p>

<p><i>As if</i>, <i>as though</i>, <i>but also</i>, <i>but likewise</i>,
<i>so that</i>, <i>except that</i>, <i>inasmuch
as</i>, <i>notwithstanding that</i>, <i>in order that</i>, <i>as well
as</i>, <i>as far as</i>, <i>so far as</i>, <i>as
little as</i>, <i>provided that</i>, <i>seeing that</i>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Write sentences using these phrase conjunctions to introduce clauses.</p>


<h3>NOUN CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_361">361.</b> We have found that there are two kinds of clauses, principal
clauses and subordinate clauses.
</p>

<p><b>A principal clause is one that does not depend on any word.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A subordinate clause is one that depends upon some word or
words in the principal clause.</b>
</p>

<p>We have found, also, that these principal clauses are always connected
by co-ordinate conjunctions, for they are of equal rank and importance;
neither is dependent upon the other.
</p>

<p>Subordinate clauses are always connected with the principal clause
by a subordinate conjunction. The subordinate clauses which we have
been studying have all been adverb clauses which are used to describe
the action expressed in the verb contained in the principal clauses.
</p>

<p>The subordinate clause in a sentence may also be used as a noun.
When the subordinate clause is used as a noun it is called a noun
clause.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_362">362.</b> <b>A noun clause is a clause used as a noun.</b>
</p>

<p>A noun clause may be used in any way in which a noun is used,
except as a possessive. It may be used as a subject, an object, a predicate
complement, or in apposition with a noun. These noun clauses
may be introduced by either relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns
or by conjunctions. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_218" title="pg 218"></a>
I know <i>who</i> he is.</li>
<li>He asked, "<i>what</i> do you want?"</li>
<li>I know <i>where</i> it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, <i>who he is</i>, is a noun clause used as the object
of the verb <i>know</i>. It tells <i>what</i> I know, and is the object of the verb
<i>know</i>,&mdash;just as if I had said; <i>I know the facts.</i>
In this sentence the noun, <i>facts</i>, is the object of the verb <i>know</i>.
</p>

<p>In the second sentence, <i>He asked, "what do you want?</i>" the noun
clause <i>what do you want</i> is the object of the verb <i>asked</i>,
and is introduced by the interrogative pronoun <i>what</i>.
</p>

<p>We will study in a subsequent lesson the use of noun clauses introduced
by relative pronouns. In this lesson we are studying the conjunctions.
</p>

<p>In the last sentence, <i>I know where it is</i>, the noun clause <i>where it is</i>,
is the object of the verb <i>know</i>, and is introduced by the conjunction
<i>where</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_363">363.</b> Noun clauses are introduced by the subordinate conjunctions,
<i>where</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>,
<i>whether</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>, and also by the subordinate
conjunction <i>that</i>. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I know <i>where</i> I can find it.</li>
<li>I inquired <i>when</i> he would arrive.</li>
<li>We do not know <i>whence</i> it cometh nor whither it goeth.</li>
<li>Ask <i>whether</i> the train has gone.</li>
<li>I don't know <i>how</i> I can find you.</li>
<li>I cannot understand <i>why</i> he does so.</li>
<li>I believe <i>that</i> he is honest.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these examples the noun clauses are used as the objects of
the verb. Noun clauses may also be used as objects of prepositions.
As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You do not listen to <i>what is said</i>.</li>
<li>He talked to me about <i>what had happened</i>.</li>
<li>He told me to come to <i>where he was</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_364">364.</b> Noun clauses may also be used as the subject of a sentence.
As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>That he is innocent</i> is admitted by all.</li>
<li><i>That he was guilty</i> has been proven.</li>
<li><i>Why he should do this</i> is very strange.</li>
<li><i>How we are to live</i> is the great problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these sentences, the noun clause is used as the subject of
the verb. You will note that most frequently the noun clause used as
subject of the verb is introduced by the subordinate conjunction <i>that</i>.
But quite often we write these sentences in a somewhat different way.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is admitted by all <i>that he is innocent</i>.</li>
<li>It has been proven <i>that he was guilty</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice in these sentences we have expressed practically
the same thought as in the sentences where the noun clause was used
as the subject of the verb.
</p>

<p>But now we have this little pronoun <i>it</i> used as the subject, instead
<a class="pagenum" id="page_219" title="pg 219"></a>
of the clause, which is the real subject of the sentence. <i>It</i> is simply used
as the introductory word in the sentence. The noun clause is in reality
the subject of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_365">365.</b>  Noun clauses may also be used as the predicate complement
with a copulative verb. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The general opinion is <i>that he is innocent</i>.</li>
<li>The problem is <i>how we may accomplish this quickly</i>.</li>
<li>The question was <i>why any one should believe such statements</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these sentences the noun clause is used as the complement
of the incomplete verbs <i>is</i> and <i>was</i>, to complete the
meaning, just as we
use a noun as the predicate complement of a copulative verb in such
sentences as, <i>Socialism is a science.</i> <i>War is murder.</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_366">366.</b> A noun clause may also be used in apposition to a noun to
explain its meaning. Apposition means to place alongside of. Note
in the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The fact, <i>that such a law had been passed</i>, alters the situation.</li>
<li>His motion, <i>that the matter should be laid on the table</i>, was adopted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the clause, <i>that such a law had been passed</i>,
is placed beside the noun <i>fact</i> and explains <i>what</i> that fact is. The clause,
<i>that the matter should be laid on the table</i>, is in apposition to and explains
the noun <i>motion</i>.</p>

<p>These noun clauses are used in apposition.</p>


<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Complete the following sentences by inserting the appropriate
conjunctions and pronouns in the blank spaces:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can you tell......Germany has a million fighting men?</li>
<li>Would you be pleased......the United States should intervene in Mexico?</li>
<li>The Mexican revolution will continue......the people possess the land.</li>
<li>No one may vote in the convention......he has credentials.</li>
<li>......Debs was in Woodstock jail, he became in Socialist.</li>
<li>......the treaty was signed, hostilities ceased.</li>
<li>We shall win......we have the courage.</li>
<li>......we have lost this battle we shall not cease to struggle.</li>
<li>All are enslaved......one is enslaved.</li>
<li>Humanity will be free......labor is free.</li>
<li>Let us do our duty......we understand it.</li>
<li>Man will never reach his best......he walks side by side with woman.</li>
<li>We must struggle......we would be free.</li>
<li>......we shout for peace, we support war.</li>
<li>All our sympathies should be with the man......toils,......we
know......labor is the foundation of all.</li>
<li>......all have the right to think and to express their thoughts
every brain will give to all the best......it has.</li>
<li>......man develops he places greater value upon his own rights.</li>
<li>......man values his own rights he begins to value the rights of others.</li>
<li>......all men give to all others the rights......they claim for
themselves this world will be civilized.</li>
</ol>

Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Note all the co-ordinate and subordinate conjunctions in the following
verses from "The Ballad of Reading Gaol." Underscore the subordinate
clauses. Are they adverb or noun clauses? Do the co-ordinate
conjunctions connect words, phrases or clauses?

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 21</h2>


<p>In Lesson No. 17 we studied concerning abstract nouns derived
from qualifying adjectives. We found that we formed these nouns
expressing quality from adjectives that describe quality by the addition
of suffixes.</p>

<p>Adjectives may likewise be formed from nouns and also from verbs
by the addition of suffixes. There are a number of suffixes which may
be used to form adjectives in this way; as, <i>al</i>, <i>ous</i>,
<i>ic</i>, <i>ful</i>, <i>less</i>, <i>able</i>,
<i>ible</i>, <i>ary</i> and <i>ory</i>. Notice the following words:
nation, <i>national</i>; peril,
<i>perilous</i>; reason, <i>reasonable</i>; sense, <i>sensible</i>;
custom, <i>customary</i>; advise,
<i>advisory</i>; hero, <i>heroic</i>; care, <i>careful</i>,
<i>careless</i>.</p>

<p>To some words, more than one suffix may be added and an adjective
of different meaning formed; for example, use, <i>useless</i>,
<i>useful</i>;
care, <i>careless</i>, <i>careful</i>.</p>

<p>Make as many adjectives as you can from the nouns and verbs
given in the spelling lesson for this week by the addition of one or
more of the following suffixes:</p>

<p><i>Al</i>, <i>less</i>, <i>ous</i>, <i>ic</i>, <i>ful</i>, <i>able</i>,
<i>ible</i>, <i>ary</i>, <i>ory</i>, and <i>ly</i>.</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 22</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We have practically finished the study of the different parts of
speech. We are now in possession of a knowledge of the tools which
we need to use in expressing ourselves. We are ready to make practical
application of this knowledge in writing and speaking. We will find
that with our increasing ability to express ourselves there comes also
the power to think clearly. The analysis of language has meant a
growing power to <i>think</i> on the part of the people.
</p>

<p>We sometimes imagine that simplicity of language was a part of
primitive life, but this is not true. Simplicity of language is the product
of high civilization. Primitive life was marked, not by simplicity of
language, but by the scarcity of language. They made one word stand
for an entire sentence, and if they wished to express a little different
meaning, an entirely different word had to be used, as for example, in
the primitive language: <i>I said to her</i>, would be one word, and
<i>I said to him</i>, would be another, entirely different, word.
</p>

<p>But as the power of thought began to develop, we began to analyze
our meaning and we found that this thought was identical except the
<i>him</i> and the <i>her</i>. So as we analyzed our thought our
expression of it <span class="corr" title="become">became</span>
more simple. In most languages, the different meaning of the
verb, for example, is expressed by an arbitrary change in the verb form.
This is called the inflection of the verb. In English we would use
several words to express the same thing. For example, the Latin word
<i>Fuissem</i> requires four English words to express the same meaning;
<i>I should have been</i>, we say in English. So instead of having to learn a
great number of different changes in the verb form, we, by the use of
auxiliary verbs, <i>have</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>be</i>, etc.,
are able to express all these
shades of thought much more simply and clearly.
</p>

<p>Most other languages also have changes for gender. Every noun
has a gender of its own and sometimes this form gives the wrong gender
to living beings and attributes sex to sexless objects and the only way
to know the gender of the noun is simply by memory. Then the adjectives,
possessive pronouns and the articles <i>a</i> and <i>the</i> have gender also
and have to be changed to suit the gender of the noun; this involves a
great effort of memory. So while the English may seem somewhat involved
to you, it is, after all, much simpler than other languages. It
has been freed from many superfluous endings and unnecessary
complications.
</p>

<p>Take a little time each day to read something out of the best literature.
The quotations given in each of these lessons are from our very
best writers. A study of these will be a wonderful help and inspiration
to you and bring you in touch with some of the great thinkers of the
revolution. They are our comrades and are putting into words the
thoughts and hopes and dreams of our lives.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_223" title="pg 223"></a>
ADJECTIVE CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_367">367.</b> In our study of subordinate clauses, we have studied subordinate
clauses used as adverbs and as nouns. We have found that adverb
clauses can be used in the same way as adverbs, to describe the time,
place, manner, cause, condition or purpose of the action expressed in
the verb. We have found, also, that a noun clause may be used in any
way in which a noun can be used, as the subject of the sentence, the
object of a verb or preposition or as the predicate complement. But
these are not the only uses to which the subordinate clause may be put.
Note the following sentences:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Wealthy</i> men desire to control the education of the people.</li>
<li>Men <i>of wealth</i> desire to control the education of the people.</li>
<li>Men <i>who are wealthy</i> desire to control the education of the people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you see any difference in the words which are used to modify
the noun <i>men</i>? In the first sentence, <i>wealthy</i> is an adjective, modifying
the noun <i>men</i>. In the second sentence, <i>of wealth</i> is a prepositional
phrase, used as an adjective modifying the noun <i>men</i>. In the last sentence,
<i>who are wealthy</i> is a clause used in exactly the same way that
the adjective <i>wealthy</i> and the adjective phrase <i>of wealth</i>
are used, to modify the noun <i>men</i>.
</p>

<p>We have expressed practically the same meaning in these three
ways: by a word; by a phrase; by a clause.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_368">368.</b> <b>A word used to describe and modify a noun is an adjective.</b></p>

<p><b>A phrase used to describe and modify a noun is an adjective phrase.</b></p>

<p><b>A clause used to describe and modify a noun is an adjective clause.</b></p>

<p>Note the difference between a phrase and a clause.</p>

<p><b id="sec_369">369.</b> A prepositional phrase, used as an adjective, consists of the
preposition and the noun which is its object, together with its modifiers.
A phrase never has either a subject or a predicate. <i>Who are wealthy</i>,
is a clause because it does contain a subject and a predicate. The pronoun
<i>who</i> is the subject in the clause, and the predicate is the copulative
verb <i>are</i> with the predicate complement, the adjective <i>wealthy</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences change the adjective into a phrase and
also into a clause, if possible. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <i>fearless</i> man always defends his rights.</li>
<li>A man <i>without fear</i> always defends his rights.</li>
<li>A man <i>who is fearless</i> always defends his rights.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The <i>unemployed</i> men are becoming desperate.</li>
<li>The <i>uneducated</i> masses are demanding equal opportunity.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_224" title="pg 224"></a>
The discovery of gold was an <i>important</i> discovery.</li>
<li><i>Unorganized</i> labor is helpless.</li>
<li>The revolution needs <i>intelligent</i> rebels.</li>
<li>A few <i>wealthy</i> men are striving to control education.</li>
<li>This will be a <i>progressive</i> movement.</li>
<li><i>Labor-saving</i> inventions throw men out of employment.</li>
<li><i>Scientific</i> men prophesy a great advance for the mass.</li>
</ol>


<h3>THE INTRODUCING WORD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_370">370.</b> You will notice that these adjective clauses are introduced
by the relative pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i> and <i>that</i>. These
relative pronouns fulfil something of the office of a conjunction, because they are
serving as connecting elements; they join these subordinate clauses to the words
which they modify. But you will note, also, that these relative pronouns
not only serve as connecting elements, but they also play a part in the
subordinate clause, as either the subject or object. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man who has no education is handicapped in the struggle.</li>
<li>Are these the books that you ordered?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, <i>who has an education</i> is an adjective clause
modifying the noun <i>man</i>, introduced by the relative pronoun <i>who</i>, which
is also the subject of the verb <i>has</i>.
</p>

<p>In the second sentence, <i>that you ordered</i> is an adjective clause,
modifying the noun <i>books</i>, introduced by the relative pronoun <i>that</i>,
which is also the object of the verb <i>ordered</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_371">371.</b> There is no need to be confused in this matter of clauses.
If the clause is used as a noun, either as the subject or the object or in
any other way in which a noun can be used, it is a noun clause. If
it is used as an adverb and will answer any of the questions <i>why</i>, <i>when</i>,
<i>where</i>, or <i>how</i>, etc., it is an adverb clause. If it is used
as an adjective,&mdash;if it modifies a noun or pronoun,&mdash;it is an adjective clause.
</p>

<p>You will note that the only way in which a noun is used that does
not have its corresponding clause is as a possessive. We do not have
possessive clauses. The clause used as an adjective always modifies a
noun or pronoun.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_372">372.</b> <b>An adjective clause is a clause used as an adjective and
hence always modifies a noun or pronoun.</b>
</p>

<p>An adjective clause may be introduced by the relative pronouns,
<i>who</i>, <i>which</i> or <i>that</i>. The use of this clause is a
great help to us in the
expression of our ideas, for it enables us to combine several sentences
containing related thoughts into one sentence so we have it all
presented to the mind at once.

<h3>WHICH RELATIVE PRONOUN TO USE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_373">373.</b> We are sometimes confused as to which relative pronoun to
use in introducing an adjective clause. We hesitate as to whether we
should use <i>that</i> or <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>. Remember that
<i>who</i> always refers to
<i>persons</i>, <i>which</i> refers to <i>animals</i> or <i>things</i>,
and <i>that</i> may refer to either
<i>persons</i>, <i>animals</i> or <i>things</i>.
</p>

<p>So when referring to a <i>person</i>, we may use either <i>who</i> or
<i>that</i>, and
when referring to <i>animals</i> or <i>things</i>, we may use either
<i>which</i> or <i>that</i>.
As, for example, we may say, either, <i>The man who was here yesterday
came back today</i>, or <i>The man that was here yesterday came back
today</i>.
Either is correct, for <i>who</i> and <i>that</i> both refer to persons.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_374">374.</b> We may make a little distinction in the use of <i>who</i>
and <i>that</i> when referring to <i>persons</i>, however. A clause introduced by
<i>that</i> is usually a restrictive clause. It limits or restricts the meaning of the
noun which it modifies. When you say, <i>The man that was here
yesterday</i>, you mean <i>that</i> man and no other, limiting your meaning to that
particular man. On the other hand, when you say, <i>The man who was
here yesterday</i>, there is no restriction or limitation expressed in
the use of the clause, but it is merely a descriptive clause, adding a new fact
to our knowledge concerning that particular man.
</p>

<p>The same is true when we are speaking of <i>things</i> using either
<i>that</i> or <i>which</i>. The clause introduced by <i>which</i> is
presumably a descriptive
clause. We do, however, often use <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> when the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_226" title="pg 226"></a>
sense of the clause is restrictive, but we should never use <i>that</i>
to introduce an adjective clause, unless the sense is restrictive. When in your
sentences you can use, instead of the relative pronoun <i>who</i> or
<i>which</i>, the conjunction <i>and</i>, you can know that the use of the pronoun
<i>who</i> or <i>which</i> is correct. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I have read the book, <i>which</i> I found very interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could say instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have read the book <i>and</i> I found it very interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This would express the same meaning. But if you say: <i>I have read
the book that I found very interesting</i>, you mean that you limit your
idea to this particular book.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_375">375.</b> We do not always observe these niceties in our spoken and
written speech, but it is interesting to know the shades of thought and
meaning which you can express by the proper use of the language.
The man who runs an engine and learns to know and love his machine
almost as though it were a human being, can easily recognize the
slightest change in the action of his machine. His ear catches the least
difference in the sound of the running of the machine, a difference which
we, who do not know and love the machine, would never notice.
</p>

<p>So it is in language. Once we have sensed its beauty and its wondrous
power of expression, we notice all these slight differences and
shades of meaning which may be expressed by the use of words. In
just the same manner the musician catches the undertones and overtones
of the music, which we, who possess an uneducated ear, cannot
know; and the artist also has a wondrous range of color, while we, who
are not sensitive to color, know only a few of the primal colors.
</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVE CLAUSES WITH CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_376">376.</b> The adjective clauses which we have been studying so far
have been introduced by relative pronouns. Adjective clauses may also
be introduced by conjunctions, such as, <i>where</i>, <i>when</i>,
<i>whence</i>, or <i>why</i>. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Antwerp is the place where a terrible battle was fought.</li>
<li>No man knows the hour when opportunity will be his.</li>
<li>Each group has a different reason why this world-war was precipitated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note in these sentences the clauses, <i>where a terrible battle was
fought</i>, <i>when opportunity will be his</i>, <i>why this world-war
was precipitated</i>,
are all adjective clauses modifying the nouns <i>place</i>, <i>hour</i>
and <i>reason</i>, and are introduced by the conjunctions <i>where</i>,
<i>when</i>, and <i>why</i>.
These are adjective clauses because they modify, by either limiting or
describing, the nouns with which they are used. You will note that we
could omit the nouns in the first two of these sentences and these
clauses would become noun clauses, for they would be used in the place of a
noun. As, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Antwerp is where a terrible battle was fought.</li>
<li>No man knows when opportunity will be his.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_227" title="pg 227"></a>
<b id="sec_377">377.</b> We determine whether a clause is an adjective or an adverb
or a noun clause just as we determine whether a word is an adjective,
adverb or noun, by the work which it does in a sentence. Noun clauses
are used in the place of a noun; adverb clauses modify verbs,
adjectives,
and adverbs; adjective clauses modify nouns and pronouns.
</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE WORD "AS"</h3>

<p><b id="sec_378">378.</b> Adjective clauses may also be introduced by <i>as</i>.
<i>As</i> is a
very convenient word and may be used in several different ways;
sometimes as an adverb, sometimes as a conjunction; and it may also be
used as a relative pronoun after <i>such</i>, <i>same</i> and
<i>many</i>. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Such books <i>as</i> you should read are listed here.</li>
<li>No such person <i>as</i> he ever came here.</li>
<li>We are facing the same crisis <i>as</i> our comrades faced.</li>
<li>This is the same <i>as</i> you gave before.</li>
<li>He has made as many mistakes <i>as</i> you have.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences <i>as</i> is really used as a relative pronoun, connecting
these adjective clauses to the words which they modify. <i>As</i> may also
be used as an adverb. <i>I am as tall as you are.</i>
</p>

<p>Here the first <i>as</i> modifies <i>tall</i> and is used as an adverb;
the second <i>as</i> is a conjunction connecting the subordinate clause <i>you
are</i>, with the principal clause. Note that in making comparisons, <i>as</i> is always
used when the comparison is equal, <i>so</i> when it is unequal, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am <i>as</i> tall as you are.</li>
<li>She is not <i>so</i> tall as you are.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have found that <i>as</i> is also used as a conjunction to introduce
an adverb clause. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>She is as beautiful <i>as</i> she is good.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clause, <i>as she is good</i>, is an adverb clause, modifying the adjective
<i>beautiful</i>. In the sentence, <i>Do as I say</i>, <i>as I say</i>
is an adverb clause of manner, modifying the verb <i>do</i>.
</p>

<h3>CONNECTIVE WORDS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_379">379.</b> Let us not be confused in this matter of connectives. There
are just four classes of connective words:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Copulative verbs.</b></li>
<li><b>Relative pronouns.</b></li>
<li><b>Prepositions.</b></li>
<li><b>Conjunctions.</b></li>
</ol>


<p><b id="sec_380">380.</b> The copulative verb is not a pure connective, for it serves
another purpose in the sentence. For example, in the sentence, <i>The
book is interesting</i>, the copulative verb <i>is</i> connects the adjective <i>interesting</i>
with the noun <i>book</i>, which it modifies; but it also is the asserting
word in the sentence. So it fulfils a double function. It is an asserting
word and also a connective word.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_228" title="pg 228"></a>
<b id="sec_381">381.</b> The relative pronoun also is not a pure connective, for it
serves two purposes in the sentence. It not only connects the clause
which it introduces, with the word which it modifies, but it also serves
as either the subject or object in the clause. For example: <i>The man
who was here has gone.</i> The clause, <i>who was here</i>, is introduced by the
relative pronoun <i>who</i>, which connects that clause with the noun
<i>man</i>, which the clause modifies. <i>Who</i> also serves as the subject of the
verb <i>was</i>.
</p>

<p>In the sentence, <i>The men whom we seek have gone</i>, the clause, <i>whom
we seek</i>, is introduced by the relative pronoun <i>whom</i>, which connects the
clause with the word <i>men</i>, which it modifies. <i>Whom</i> also serves as the
object of the verb in the clause, the verb <i>seek</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_382">382.</b> A preposition is not a pure connective, since it serves a double
function. It shows the relation of its object to the rest of the sentence
and also governs the form of its object. As, for example, in the sentence:
<i>The man before me is not the culprit</i>, the preposition <i>before</i> connects
its object <i>me</i> with the noun <i>man</i>, which the prepositional
phrase modifies, showing the relation between them; and it governs the form of
its object, for the pronoun following a preposition must be used in the
<i>object</i> form.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_383">383.</b> Even co-ordinate conjunctions can scarcely be considered
pure connectives unless it be the co-ordinate conjunction <i>and</i>.
Co-ordinate conjunctions such as <i>but</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>still</i>,
<i>however</i>, etc., not only connect
words, phrases and clauses of equal rank, but in addition to connecting
the words and expressions they also indicate that they are opposite
in thought.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_384">384.</b> Co-ordinate conjunctions like <i>therefore</i>,
<i>hence</i>, <i>then</i>, etc.,
connect words, phrases and clauses of equal rank, and also introduce a
<i>reason</i> or <i>cause</i>. Co-ordinate conjunctions like <i>or</i>,
<i>either</i>, <i>nor</i>, <i>neither</i>,
<i>whether</i>, etc., connect words, phrases and clauses of equal rank,
and also express the choice of an alternative. Thus these co-ordinate
conjunctions can scarcely be considered as pure connectives.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_385">385.</b> Subordinate conjunctions are most frequently used to introduce
adverb clauses and have an adverbial meaning. They express, as
do adverbs, <i>place</i>, <i>time</i>, <i>manner</i>, <i>cause</i>,
<i>reason</i>, <i>purpose</i>, <i>condition</i> or
<i>result</i>. Some authorities indicate this double function by calling such
words as these conjunctive adverbs, because, even when they are used
as conjunctions, they retain some of their adverbial force.
</p>

<p>But according to our rule that every word in the sentence is classified
according to the function which it performs in that sentence, all
words that perform the function of a conjunction are called conjunctions,
although we understand that these conjunctions which introduce
dependent clauses do still retain some of their adverbial meaning.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the connectives are in italics. Determine
whether they are copulative verbs, relative pronouns, prepositions,
co-ordinate conjunctions or subordinate conjunctions.

<blockquote>
<p>"There was a bird's egg once, picked up by chance upon the ground, and
those who found it bore it home and placed it under a barn-yard fowl.
And in time the chick bred out, and those who had found it chained it by the
leg to a log lest it should stray and be lost. And by and by they gathered
round it, and speculated as to what the bird might be.</p>

<p>One said, "It is surely a waterfowl, a duck, or it may be a goose; if we
took it to the water it would swim and gabble." But another said, "It
has no webs to its feet; it is a barn-yard fowl; if you should let it loose
it will scratch and cackle with the others on the dungheap." But a third
speculated, "Look now at its curved beak; no doubt it is a parrot, and can crack
nuts."</p>

<p>But a fourth said, "No, but look at its wings; perhaps it is a bird of
great flight." But several cried, "Nonsense! No one has ever seen it
fly! Why should it fly? Can you suppose that a thing can do a thing which no
one has ever seen it do?" And the bird, with its leg chained close to
the log, preened its wings.</p>

<p>So they say about it, speculating and discussing it: and one said this,
and another that.</p>

<p>And all the while, as they talked, the bird sat motionless, "Suppose we
let the creature loose to see what it will do?"&mdash;and the bird shivered.
But the others cried, "It is too valuable; it might get lost. If it were to
try to fly it might fall down and break its neck." And the bird, with its foot
chained to the log, sat looking upward into the clear sky; the sky, in which it
had never been&mdash;for the bird&mdash;the bird, knew what it would do&mdash;because it
was an eaglet!"</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 22</h2>


<p>In our study of the spelling of English words we have found that
there are not many rules that apply. In fact, the only way to learn to
spell correctly is by sheer dint of memory.
</p>

<p>In last week's lesson we found that a number of adjectives can be
formed from nouns or verbs by the addition of <i>able</i> or <i>ible</i>, but we find
it difficult to determine whether to add <i>able</i> or <i>ible</i>. The
sound is practically the same and we are confused as to whether we should use <i>a</i> or
<i>i</i>. There is no rule which applies in this case and there is nothing to do
but to master the spelling of these words by memory. These are words which
we use a great deal and which are very helpful members of our working
vocabulary.
</p>

<p>Our list of words in this week's lesson contain some of the most
common words which we use ending in <i>ible</i> or <i>able</i>. The
words for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all end in <i>able</i>; the words for
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday will end in <i>ible</i>. Notice them carefully and
get fixed firmly in mind the correct spelling. Notice also that most of
these adjectives can be changed into adverbs by changing <i>ble</i> to
<i>bly</i>. So when you have added these adjectives to your vocabulary, you have
also added the adverbs as well.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 23</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In this lesson we are taking up the study of interjections. Interjections
are the language of emotion. This was probably the earliest
form of speech. You notice that children use these exclamations often,
and the sounds which are imitations of the noises about them. This
language belongs also to the savage, whose peculiar and expressive
grunts contain whole areas of condensed thought. As we progress from
feeling to thinking, the use of the interjection diminishes.
</p>

<p>You will not find interjections used in a book on mathematics or
physical science or history. To attempt to read one of these books
may make you use interjections and express your emotion in violent
language, but you will not find interjections in these books. These
books of science are books that express thought and not feeling. But
if you turn to fiction and to oratory you will find the interjection used
freely, for these are the books which treat of the human emotions and
feelings. Especially in poetry will you find the interjection used, for
poetry is the language of feeling and the interjection is an important
part of the poet's stock in trade.
</p>

<p>In conversation, these exclamatory words are very useful. They
fill the gaps in our conversation and they help to put the listener and the
speaker in touch with one another. They are usually accompanied by
a gesture, which adds force to the word. The tone of the voice in which
they are expressed also means a great deal. You can say, Oh! in half a
dozen different ways; you may express surprise, wonder, joy, sorrow,
pain, or disgust. A great many different and widely separated feelings
can be expressed simply by the tone in which you use the exclamatory
words. Some one has said that these words grease the wheels of talk.
They serve to help the timid, to give time to the unready and to keep up
a pleasant semblance of familiarity.
</p>

<p>When we use them in the stress of emotion to express deep feeling,
their use is perfectly justified. But one author has called these words
"the miserable refuge of the speechless." We use them many times
because we have no words with which to express ourselves. This use
is unjustified. Be careful that you do not use them in this way. It
has been said that the degree of a man's civilization can be pretty
fairly judged by the expletives which he uses. Do not sprinkle your
conversation
with interjections and even stronger words because you are at a
loss for other words.
</p>

<p>There is a rich mine of words at your disposal. Do not be satisfied
with bits of glass that have no value, when the rich diamonds of real
expression can be yours for just a little digging. Save your emotional
language for the time when you really need it to express deep emotion.

INTERJECTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_386">386.</b> We have been studying the parts of speech,&mdash;the elements
of which sentences are composed. But we have another class of words
which we call parts of speech because they are spoken and written as
words, but which are really not parts of speech in the same sense as the
words which we have been discussing. These are words which we call
interjections.
</p>

<p>Interjection means, literally, thrown between, from <i>jecto</i>, to
throw,and <i>inter</i>, between. So interjections do not enter into the
constructionof sentences but are only thrown in between. Every word that is really
a part of the sentence is either a noun, a pronoun, a verb, an
adjective, an adverb, a preposition or a conjunction.
</p>

<p>There are words, however, that we use with sentences which do not
enter into the construction. For example, you say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh! I am wounded.</li>
<li>Aha! I have conquered.</li>
<li>Alas! He came too late.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_387">387.</b> Words which we use in these sentences, like, <i>oh</i>,
<i>aha</i>, <i>alas</i>,
are used to express the emotion which you feel in making the statement.
Your <i>Oh!</i> in a sentence like: <i>Oh! I am wounded</i>, would
probably sound very much like a groan. But your <i>Aha!</i> in the, <i>Aha! I have
conquered</i>, will sound like a shout of victory, and your <i>Alas!</i> in the
sentence, <i>Alas! He came too late</i>, will express grief or regret over the fact that he
came too late.
</p>

<p>These words do not assert anything and very much of the meaning
which we give them must come from the tone in which they are uttered.
Every one, upon hearing them, knows at once whether they express
grief or delight.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_388">388.</b> <b>An interjection is an exclamatory word or phrase used
to express feeling or to imitate some sound.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_389">389.</b> Interjections may be divided into four classes:
</p>

<p>1. <b>Words which we use instead of an assertion to express feeling
of various kinds</b>, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Surprise or wonder; as, <i>Oh</i>, <i>Aha</i>, <i>What</i>.</li>
<li>(b) Pleasure, joy, or exaltation; as, <i>Hurrah</i>, <i>Ha, Ha</i>.</li>
<li>(c) Pain, sadness or sorrow; as, <i>Alas</i>, <i>Alack</i>.</li>
<li>(d) Contempt or disgust; as <i>Fie</i>, <i>Fudge</i>, <i>Ugh</i>,
<i>Pshaw</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <b>Words used instead of a question</b>; as, <i>Eh?</i> <i>Hey?</i></p>

<p>3. <b>Words used instead of a command</b>; as:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a)  To call attention; as, <i>Hello</i>, <i>Ahoy</i>, <i>Whoa</i>.</li>
<li>(b)  To express silence; as, <i>Shh</i>, <i>Hush</i>, <i>Hist</i>.</li>
<li>(c)  To direct or drive out, etc., as, <i>Whoa</i>, <i>Gee</i>,
<i>Haw</i>, <i>Scat</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. <b>Words used to imitate sounds made by animals, machines,
etc.</b>, as, <i>Bow-wow</i>, <i>Ding-dong</i>, <i>Bang</i>,
<i>Rub-a-dub</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_234" title="pg 234"></a>
When we wish to imitate noises or sounds made by animals, machines,
etc., in writing, we spell out the words as nearly as we can, just
as we write <i>ding-dong</i> to represent the sound of the bell or
<i>tick-tock</i> to indicate the ticking of a clock.
</p>

<p>Note that a number of our verbs and nouns have been formed from
imitating the sound which these nouns or verbs describe or express,
as for instance, <i>crash</i>, <i>roar</i>, <i>buzz</i>, <i>hush</i>,
<i>groan</i>, <i>bang</i>, <i>puff</i>, etc.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Mark the interjections in the following sentences. Which express
surprise? Which joy? Which sorrow? Which disgust?
</p>

<ol>
<li>Alas! We shall never meet again.</li>
<li>Bravo! You have done well.</li>
<li>Pshaw! Is that the best you can do?</li>
<li>Ship ahoy! All hands on deck.</li>
<li>Hello! When did you come?</li>
<li>Hurrah! We have won the victory.</li>
<li>Alas, alack! Those days will never come again.</li>
<li>Hist! You must be as still as mice.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Write sentences using an interjection to express: 1. Joy. 2. Surprise.
3. Pain. 4. Sorrow. 5. Disgust. 6. To ask a question. 7. To
call attention. 8. To silence. 9. To direct. 10. To imitate the sound
made by an animal. 11. By a machine.</p>


<h3>EXCLAMATORY WORDS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_390">390.</b> Interjections express only emotion or feeling. They do not
express ideas. However, we have a number of words which are used
somewhat as interjections are used, which we may class as exclamatory
words, but they express more than interjections, for they express ideas
as well as emotions; but, like interjections, they are used
independently and have no part in the construction of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_391">391.</b>  Many ordinary words and phrases are used in this way as
exclamations. When they are so used they have no place in the
construction of the sentence; that is, they do not depend upon the sentence in
which they are used, in any way. A noun used in this way is not used
as the subject or the object, but simply as an exclamation.
</p>


<p>For example; the noun <i>nonsense</i> may be used as an interjection,
as in the sentence; <i>Nonsense! I do not believe a word of it.</i> In
this sentence, <i>nonsense</i> is a noun used as an interjection and plays no
part in the sentence, either as subject or object, but is an independent
construction. There are a number of words used in this way:
</p>

<p>1. Nouns and pronouns, as <i>fire</i>, <i>mercy</i>, <i>shame</i>,
<i>nonsense</i>, <i>the idea</i>, <i>what</i>.
</p>

<p>2. Verbs like, <i>help</i>, <i>look</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>listen</i>,
<i>hark</i>, <i>behold</i>, <i>begone</i>.
</p>

<p>3. Adjectives like, <i>good</i>, <i>well</i>, <i>brave</i>,
<i>welcome</i>, <i>strange</i>.
</p>

<p>4. Adverbs like, <i>out</i>, <i>indeed</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>,
<i>back</i>, <i>forward</i>.
</p>

<p>5. Prepositions like, <i>on</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>down</i>.
</p>

<p>6. Phrases like, <i>Oh dear</i>, <i>dear me</i>, <i>good bye</i>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_235" title="pg 235"></a>
Words and phrases such as these, used as exclamations, are not true
interjections, for they express a little more than feeling. They express
an idea which, in our haste, we do not completely express. The other
words necessary to the expression of the idea are omitted because of
the stress of emotion. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Silence! I will hear no more.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence it is understood that we mean, <i>Let us have silence,
I will hear no more</i>. But in the stress of our emotion, we have omitted
the words, <i>Let us have</i>.
</p>

<p>If we say, <i>Good! that will do splendidly</i>, you know that we mean,
<i>That is good</i>, we have simply omitted <i>That is</i>, which is
necessary to complete
the sentence. Sometimes when we are greatly excited we abandon
our sentence construction altogether and use only the most important
words. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A sail! a sail!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a sentence, for it does not contain a verb, yet we know
that what was meant was, <i>I see a sail, I see a sail</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Write sentences using the words given in the foregoing list as
exclamatory words, and add as many more to the list as you can think of.
</p>

<h3>YES AND NO</h3>

<p><b id="sec_392">392.</b> The words <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>, which we use in reply to
questions were originally adverbs, but we no longer use them as adverbs. We no
longer combine them with other words as modifying or limiting words,
but use them independently. They are in themselves complete answers.
Thus, if you ask me the question, <i>Will you come?</i> I may say
<i>Yes</i>, meaning,
<i>I will come</i>; or, <i>No</i>, meaning, <i>I will not come</i>.
</p>

<p>The responsives <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> thus stand for whole sentences,
so they are really independent words. We may use them in connection with
other sentences. For example; I may say, <i>Yes, I will come</i>, or
<i>No, I will not come</i>. Used in this way, they still retain an independent
construction in the sentence. We call them responsives because they are
used in response to questions.
</p>

<h3>OTHER INDEPENDENT EXPRESSIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_393">393.</b> Other words may be used in an independent construction in
sentences, without depending upon the sentence in which they are used
or without having the sentences depend upon them, such as:
</p>

<p>1. <b>A word used in address.</b> For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mr. President, I move that a committee be now appointed.</li>
<li>Fellow Workers, I rise to address you.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_236" title="pg 236"></a>
In these sentences, <i>Mr. President</i> and <i>Fellow Workers</i> are
nouns used independently; that is, they are neither the subject of the
sentence nor used as object or predicate complement. They are independent of
all other words in the sentence.
</p>

<p>The most common use of words used independently in direct address
occurs with imperative sentences. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Comrades</i>, rouse yourselves.</li>
<li><i>Men</i>, strike for freedom.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <b>Exclamatory expressions.</b> These are nouns used in the manner
in which we have already discussed, as in the sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Nonsense!</i> I do not believe a word of it.</li>
<li>Alas! poor <i>Yorick</i>! I knew him well.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. <b>Words and phrases used parenthetically</b>, as for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>By the way</i>, I met a friend of yours today.</li>
<li>We cannot, <i>however</i>, join you at once.</li>
<li>He called, <i>it seems</i>, while we were gone.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences such words as, <i>however</i>, and such phrases as,
<i>by the way</i>, and, <i>it seems</i>, are used independently,&mdash;in
parenthesis, as it
were; that is, they are just thrown into the sentences in such a way
that they do not modify or depend upon any other word in the sentence.
When we analyze our sentences, these independent words are not
considered as elements of the sentences in which they are used. It is sufficient
to say that they are independent words.
</p>

<p>4. <b>Conjunctions used as introductory words.</b> We have noted the
use of conjunctions like the co-ordinates <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, etc.,
and the subordinates
<i>because</i>, <i>in order that</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>for</i>,
<i>wherefore</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>whether</i>, etc.,
which are used to introduce sentences and connect them in thought with
sentences and paragraphs which have gone before.
</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY WORDS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_394">394.</b> <b>We have a number of words which we use to introduce
our sentences.</b> They are such words as, <i>so</i>, <i>well</i> and
<i>why</i>. These are
ordinarily adverbs, but when they are used merely to introduce a
sentence they retain little of their adverbial force. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>So</i>, that is your only excuse.</li>
<li><i>Well</i>, I cannot understand why you should accept it.</li>
<li><i>Why</i>, that is no reason at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, <i>so</i>, <i>well</i> and <i>why</i> do not modify
any of the words
in the sentences, but are used merely to introduce the sentences. They
serve in a measure to connect them with something which has gone before.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_395">395.</b> <b>The adverb</b> <i>there</i> <b>is also used as an
introductory word.</b> When it is used in this manner, it loses its adverbial force.
<i>There</i>, as ordinarily used, is an adverb of place, but it is often used to
introduce a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_237" title="pg 237"></a>
sentence. For example: <i>There is some mistake about it.</i> In this
sentence <i>there</i> is not used as an adverb, but it is used simply as an
introductory word. It is used to introduce a sentence in which the verb comes before
the real subject. <i>Mistake</i> is the real subject of the verb is, and
<i>there</i> is used simply as the introductory word.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_396">396.</b> <b>The indefinite pronoun</b> <i>it</i> <b>is also used as
an introductory word</b>, to introduce a sentence in much the same manner as
<i>there</i>. The real subject of the verb occurs later in the sentence. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is best to know the truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be written, <i>To know the truth is best</i>, and the entire
meaning of the sentence would be conveyed.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_397">397.</b> <b>Adverbs of mode.</b> You remember in our study of
adverbs,
we had certain adverbs which were called adverbs of mode. These are
used to modify the entire sentence. They express the feeling in which
the entire sentence is uttered. Adverbs of mode may be regarded also
as independent words. They are such words as, <i>indeed</i>,
<i>surely</i>, <i>certainly</i>,
<i>perhaps</i>, etc. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Indeed</i>, I cannot tell you now.</li>
<li><i>Surely</i>, I will comply with your request.</li>
<li><i>Perhaps</i> it may be true.</li>
<li>I <i>certainly</i> hope to do so before long.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Note in the following sentences the words which are pure interjections,
and those which are other parts of speech used as exclamatory
words. Mark those which are used in direct address, those which are
used parenthetically, and those which are used as mere introductory
words.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Oh, it seems impossible to believe it.</li>
<li>Surely, you will accept my word.</li>
<li>Nonsense, there is not the least truth in the story.</li>
<li>It will be impossible for us to join.</li>
<li>Therefore we urge you to join in this campaign.</li>
<li>There is only one solution to the problem.</li>
<li>It is difficult to discover the true facts.</li>
<li>Well, I have done my best to persuade you.</li>
<li>Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of order.</li>
<li>Comrades, come and stand for your rights.</li>
<li>Yes, I have studied that philosophy.</li>
<li>Enough! we have been enslaved too long.</li>
<li>Hark! we hear the tramp of the army of labor.</li>
<li>Alas! that any should refuse to join in this battle.</li>
<li>You have not, it seems, understood the issue.</li>
<li>Indeed, solidarity is our only hope.</li>
<li>Br-r-r-r-r-r-r, thus whirl the machines that grind our children's lives.</li>
<li>Hush! Over the crash of the cannon sounds the wail of Europe's women and children.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_238" title="pg 238"></a>
EXPLANATORY WORDS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_398">398.</b> We sometimes use words which do not belong in the
construction of a sentence to explain other words in the sentence. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>We, <i>the undersigned</i>, subscribe as follows:</li>

<li>Helen Keller, <i>the most wonderful woman of this age</i>, champions the
cause of the working class.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the words, <i>the undersigned</i>, are added to the
pronoun <span class="corr" title="I"><i>we</i></span> to explain who <i>we</i> means. In the second
sentence, the words,
<i>the most wonderful woman of this age</i>, are added to explain who Helen
Keller is. Words added to other words in this way are called explanatory
words. They are placed in apposition to the noun which they explain.
Apposition means <i>by the side of</i>, or <i>in position near</i>. You
remember that in clauses we found that a clause may be placed in apposition
with a noun to explain the meaning of that noun. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an old saying, <i>in union there is strength</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These words in apposition may themselves be modified or limited
by other words or phrases or clauses. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Helen Keller, the most wonderful woman of this age, champions the
cause of the working class.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>woman</i> is the noun placed in apposition to the
particular name, Helen Keller, and the noun <i>woman</i> is modified by the
adjectives <i>the</i>, and <i>wonderful</i>, and by the phrase <i>of
this age</i>.
</p>

<p>Sometimes a second explanatory word is placed in apposition to
the first one. This is quite often the case in legal documents or
resolutions, where the language is quite formal. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We, the undersigned, <i>members of Local No. 38</i>, do hereby move, etc.</li>
<li>I, John Smith, <i>Notary Public</i>, in and for the county of Clay, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These words, <i>undersigned</i> and <i>members</i>, are both placed in
apposition to the pronoun <i>We</i>, explaining to whom that pronoun refers.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>In the following sentences note the explanatory words and their
modifiers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wendell Phillips, the great abolitionist, was a man of genius.</li>

<li>Buckle, the historian, writes from the view point of the
materialistic conception of history.</li>

<li>Giovannitti, the poet, wrote "Arrows in the Gale."</li>

<li>Helen Keller, champion of the working class, wrote the introduction
to this book.</li>

<li>We, the workers of the world, will some day claim our own.</li>

<li>He was found guilty of treason, a crime punishable by death.</li>

<li>Ferrer, the martyr of the twentieth century, was put to death
by the Spanish government.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_239" title="pg 239"></a>
Jaures, the great French socialist, was the first martyr to peace.</li>

<li>But ye, Plebs, Populace, People, Rabble, Mob, Proletariat, live
and abide forever.</li>

<li>Ye are eternal, even as your father, labor, is eternal.</li>

<li>This document, the Constitution of the United States, hinders
the progress of the people.</li>

<li>The memory of Guttenberg, the inventor of the printing press,
should be reverenced by every class-conscious worker.</li>

<li>Wallace, the scientist and author, was co-discoverer with Darwin
of the theory of evolution.</li>

<li>Karl Marx, the thinker, applied this theory to social forces.</li>

<li>Do you understand the three basic principles of Socialism&mdash;the
class struggle, economic determinism and surplus value?</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Read the following list of words and note the ideas which they
suggest to you, then make sentences containing these words, <i>modified
by a word or group of words in apposition</i>, which explain more fully
these words.
</p>

<p>Law, martyr, society, education, inventor, commander, freedom, Eugene
V. Debs, Karl Marx, Kaiser Wilhelm, The Balkan, Lawrence, Colorado,
Calumet.</p>

<h3>ABSOLUTE CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p><b id="sec_399">399.</b> We have found that every word in a sentence bears some
relation to every other word, except these words which we have been
studying, which we use independently. These explanatory words which
we have just been studying are not used independently, but do in a
sense modify the noun with which they are placed in apposition.
Sometimes we place a noun or a pronoun and its modifiers alongside the
whole sentence and it does not really modify any part of the sentence,
but modifies the whole sentence in a way, for it expresses an attendant
thought or an accompanying circumstance. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The workers being unorganized, the strike was easily defeated.</li>
<li>The strikers having won, work was resumed on their terms.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The workers being unorganised</i> and <i>the strikers having won</i>
are not clauses for they do not contain a verb. <i>Being unorganized</i> and
<i>having won</i> are participles. Neither do they modify any word in the
sentence. They are not placed in apposition with any other word. While they do
express a thought in connection with the sentence, in construction they
seem to be cut loose from the rest of the sentence; that is, they are
not closely connected with the sentence, hence they are called absolute
constructions. <i>Ab</i> means from, and <i>solute</i>, loose; so this means,
literally, loose from the rest of the sentence.
</p>

<p>We speak of these as absolute constructions, instead of independent,
because the thought expressed is connected with the main thought of
the sentence and is really a part of it. Notice that the noun used in
the absolute construction is not the <i>subject</i> of the sentence.
</p>

<p>Take the sentence, <i>The workers being unorganized, the strike was</i>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_240" title="pg 240"></a>
<i>easily defeated</i>, the noun <i>strike</i> is the subject of the
sentence, and the noun <i>workers</i> is used in the absolute construction with the
participle, <i>being unorganized</i>.
</p>

<p>These absolute constructions can ordinarily be rewritten into adverb
clauses. For example, this sentence might read: <i>The strike was easily
defeated because the workers were unorganized.</i> Do not make the
mistake of rewriting your sentences and using the noun in the absolute
construction as the subject of the sentence. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The workers, being unorganized, were easily defeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not the meaning of this sentence. The meaning of the sentence
is that the <i>strike</i> was easily defeated <i>because</i> the workers
were unorganized.
But the adverb clause, <i>because the workers were unorganized</i>,
instead of being written as an adverb clause, has been written in
the absolute construction, <i>the workers being unorganized</i>.
</p>

<p>While it is nearly always possible to change these absolute
constructions
into adverb clauses the sentences are sometimes weakened by the
change. These absolute constructions often enable us to make a statement
in a stronger manner than we could make it with a clause or in
any other way.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 7</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, note the groups of words which are used
in absolute construction. Rewrite these sentences and if possible change
these words used in absolute construction into equivalent adverb phrases
or clauses. Note how some of the sentences are weakened when you
make this change.
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Nationalism having been taught to generation after generation</i>,
the workers obeyed the call of the master class to slaughter their
fellow workers.</li>

<li><i>The hour having arrived</i>, Ferrer was blindfolded and led forth
to die.</li>

<li><i>The mass being without education</i>, capitalism gains an easy
victory.</li>

<li><i>The class struggle being a fact</i>, why should we hesitate to
join our class?</li>

<li><i>These facts being true</i>, such a conclusion is inevitable.</li>

<li><i>Darwin having stated the theory of evolution</i>, Marx applied its
principles to social science.</li>

<li><i>Chattel slavery having been destroyed</i>, wage-slavery became the
corner stone of capitalism.</li>

<li><i>The price having been paid</i>, we claim our own.</li>

<li><i>The battle ended</i>, the army left the trenches.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 8</h4>

<p>Mark the interjections in the following quotations. Note the independent
constructions. Mark the words used as explanatory words in
apposition.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the mind's eye, I see a wonderful building, something like the
Coliseum of ancient Rome. The galleries are black with people; tier upon tier
rise like waves the multitude of spectators who have come to see a great contest.
A great contest, indeed! A contest in which all the world and all the
centuries are interested. It is the contest&mdash;the fight to death&mdash;between Truth and
Error.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_241" title="pg 241"></a>
The door opens, and a slight, small, shy and insignificant looking thing
steps into the arena. It is Truth. The vast audience bursts into hilarious and
derisive laughter. What! Is this Truth? This shuddering thing in tattered
clothes, and almost naked? And the house shakes again with mocking and hisses.
</p>

<p>The door opens again, and Error enters&mdash;clad in cloth of gold, imposing
in appearance, tall of stature, glittering with gems, sleek and huge and
ponderous, causing the building to tremble with the thud of its steps. The audience
is for a moment dazzled into silence, then it breaks into applause, long
and deafening. "Welcome!" "Welcome!" is the greeting from the multitude.
"Welcome!" shout ten thousand throats.
</p>

<p>The two contestants face each other. Error, in full armor&mdash;backed by the
sympathies of the audience, greeted by the clamorous cheering of the
spectators; and Truth, scorned, scoffed at, and hated. "The issue is a foregone
conclusion," murmurs the vast audience. "Error will trample Truth under its feet."

<p>The battle begins. The two clinch, separate, and clinch again. Truth
holds its own. The spectators are alarmed. Anxiety appears in their
faces. Their voices grow faint. Is it possible? Look! See! There! Error
recedes! It fears the gaze of Truth! It shuns its beauteous eyes! Hear it shriek
and scream as it feels Truth's squeeze upon its wrists. Error is trying to
break away from Truth's grip. It is making for the door. It is gone!
</p>

<p>The spectators are mute. Every tongue is smitten with the palsy. The
people bite their lips until they bleed. They cannot explain what they
have seen. "Oh! who would have believed it?" "Is it possible?"&mdash;they exclaim.
But they cannot doubt what their eyes have seen&mdash;that puny and
insignificant looking thing called Truth has put ancient and entrenched Error, backed
by the throne, the altar, the army, the press, the people and the gods&mdash;to rout.

<h2>SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 23</h2>


<p>Many words contain letters for which there are no corresponding
sounds in the spoken words. Thus, in the spoken word <i>though</i> there
are only two sounds, the <i>th</i> and the <i>o</i>; <i>u</i> and
<i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are silent. There
are a great many words in the English language which contain these
silent letters. There has been a movement inaugurated for the purpose
of simplifying the spelling of these words, omitting these silent
letters. Some writers have adopted this method of simplified spelling, and so in
some magazines and books which you read you will find these silent
letters dropped; for example, you will find <i>though</i> spelled <i>tho</i>,
<i>through</i> spelled <i>thru</i>.
</p>

<p>This method of simplified spelling has not been universally adopted
and we have not followed it in these lessons because we feared that it
would be confusing. Probably in most of your reading you will find
the old method of spelling followed and all of these silent letters
included. No doubt, as time goes on, we shall adopt this simplified method
of spelling and drop all of these silent and useless letters.
</p>

<p>In our spelling lesson for this week we have a number of words
containing silent letters.
</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="page_242" title="pg 242"></a>
MONDAY</h4>

<p>In a number of words you will find <i>ea</i> pronounced as short
<i>e</i>. The board of simplified spelling has suggested that we drop the <i>a</i>,
which is a silent letter, from these words. If we adopted their suggestion, words
like <i>head</i> would be spelled <i>hed</i>. Note the spelling of the
following words in which <i>ea</i> is pronounced as short <i>e</i> and the <i>a</i> is
silent.</p>

<p>Spread, stead, threat, meant, pleasant, stealth.</p>

<h4>TUESDAY</h4>

<p>We have a number of words ending in <i>ough</i> in which the <i>gh</i>
is silent.</p>

<p>1.  In some of these words the <i>ou</i> is pronounced like <i>ow</i>.
We have already changed the spelling of a few of these words, for example, we
no longer use <i>plough</i>, but write it <i>plow</i>.</p>

<p>2.  In other words ending with <i>ough</i> the <i>ugh</i> is silent and
the words end with a long <i>o</i> sound, as in <i>though</i>. Many writers have
dropped the silent letters ugh and spell this simply <i>tho</i>.</p>

<p>3. A few other words ending with <i>ough</i> end with a <i>u</i> sound
and those who adopt the simplified spelling have dropped the <i>ough</i> and
used simply <i>u</i>, as in <i>through</i>; many writers spell it simply
<i>thru</i>. Observe the spelling of the following words and mark the silent letters:
</p>
<p>Bough, through, thorough, furlough, borough, though.</p>

<h4>WEDNESDAY</h4>

<p>We have a number of words ending in <i>mn</i> in which the <i>n</i> is
silent. Note the spelling of the following words:</p>

<p>Autumn, solemn, column, kiln, hymn, condemn.</p>

<h4>THURSDAY</h4>

<p>We have a number of words containing a silent <i>b</i>. Notice the
spelling of the following words:</p>

<p>Doubt, debt, dumb, limb, thumb, lamb.</p>

<h4>FRIDAY</h4>

<p>A number of words end with silent <i>ue</i> after <i>g</i>. Some writers
omit the ue and probably after a while we will drop this silent <i>ue</i>,
but you will find it used now in most of your reading. These are such words as:</p>

<p>Catalogue, demagogue, decalogue, tongue, league, harangue.</p>

<h4>SATURDAY</h4>

<p>We have a number of words ending with <i>gh</i> in which the <i>gh</i>
has the sound of <i>f</i>, as in the following words:
</p>

<p>Trough, rough, enough, laugh, tough, cough.</p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 24</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We have finished our study of the different parts of speech and are
going to enter upon the work of sentence building. In the next few
lessons we will gather up all that we have been studying in these
lessons so far. This is a good time to give this work a thorough review.
Perhaps there have been a number of things in the lessons which you
have not thoroughly understood, or perhaps there have been some rules
for which you have not seen the reason. Now as we begin to construct
our sentences, all of this will fit into its place. We shall find the
reason for many of the things which may not have seemed thoroughly clear
to us.
</p>

<p>There <i>is</i> a science in language as in everything else, and
language, after all, is governed by the will of the people. This has seemed so
self-evident to those who make a special study of the language and its development
that they have given this power a special name. They speak of
the "Genius of the Language" as though there was some spirit guiding
and directing the developing power of language.
</p>

<p>There is a spirit guiding and directing the developing power of
language. That spirit is the creative genius of the people. It is the same
spirit that would guide and direct all phases of life into full and free
expression, if it were permitted to act. There being no private profit
connected with the control of the language, the creative genius of the
people has had fuller sway.
</p>

<p>The educator sitting in his study cannot make arbitrary rules to
change or conserve the use of words. The people themselves are the
final arbiter in language. It is the current usage among the masses
which puts the final stamp upon any word. Think what this same
creative genius might do if it were set free in social life, in
industrial life. It would work out those principles which were best fitted to the
advance of the people themselves. But those who would profit by the
enslavement of the people have put stumbling blocks,&mdash;laws, conventions,
morals, customs,&mdash;in the way of the people.
</p>

<p>Their creative genius does not have full sway or free sweep, but
let us rejoice that in language, at least, we are free. And let us, as
we realize the power of the people manifest in this phase of life,
determine that the same power shall be set free to work out its will in all life.
Some day the revolution will come. The people will be free to rule
themselves, to express their will, not in the realms of words alone, but
in their social and economic life; and as we become free within, dare
to think for ourselves and to demand our own, we each become a torch
of the revolution, a center of rebellion&mdash;one of those who make straight
the path for the future.
</p>

<p class="center">Yours for the Revolution,</p>
<p class="sig">THE PEOPLE'S COLLEGE.</p>


<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_244" title="pg 244"></a>
SENTENCE BUILDING</h3>

<p><b id="sec_400">400.</b> Every expression of a complete thought is a sentence. A
sentence is the unit in language. Words are the material out of which
we build our sentences, so we have been studying the various parts of
speech that are used in sentence building. Now we are ready to use
these parts of speech in the building of sentences. We have found that
there are eight parts of speech, though the interjection, which is
termed the eighth part of speech, is not in reality a part of the sentence; but
is a complete, independent construction. So in your sentences all of the
many hundreds of words which we use can be grouped into seven divisions;
<i>nouns</i>, <i>pronouns</i>, <i>adjectives</i>, <i>verbs</i>,
<i>adverbs</i>, <i>prepositions</i> and <i>conjunctions</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_401">401.</b> You remember in our first lesson we found that there were
just three kinds of sentences. The <i>assertive</i>, the
<i>interrogative</i> and the
<i>imperative</i>; or in other words, sentences which state a
<i>fact</i>, ask a <i>question</i>
or give a <i>command</i>. We also found that these three kinds of
sentences could all be expressed in <i>exclamatory</i> form.
</p>

<h3>THREE KINDS OF SENTENCES</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Assertive.</b>  Makes a statement.</li>
<li><b>Interrogative.</b> Asks a question.</li>
<li><b>Imperative.</b>  Gives a command.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Assertive sentence;</b> <i>I remember the day.</i></li>
<li><b>Interrogative sentence;</b> <i>Do you not remember the day?</i></li>
<li><b>Imperative sentence;</b> <i>Remember the day.</i></li>
</ul>

<h4>In Exclamatory Form</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Assertive;</b> <i>Nonsense! I remember the day.</i></li>
<li><b>Interrogative;</b> <i>What! Do you not remember the day?</i></li>
<li><b>Imperative;</b> <i>Oh come! Remember the day.</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>ANALYSIS&mdash;SIMPLE SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_402">402.</b> Now that we have finished the study of the various parts
of speech, we are ready for sentence building and for sentence analysis.
Sentence analysis is the breaking up of the sentence into its different
parts in order to find out how and why it is thus put together. To
analyze anything is to break it up or separate it into its different
parts. We speak of analyzing a sentence when we pick out the subject and the
predicate and their modifiers, because we thus unloosen them or separate
them from one another.
</p>

<p>These parts of the sentence are called the elements of the sentence.
The elements of a sentence consist of the words, phrases and clauses
used in forming the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_403">403.</b> Let us begin from the simplest beginning and build up our
sentences, using the various parts of speech as we have studied them.
Let us take the simplest form of sentence which we can consider. For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Men work.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_245" title="pg 245"></a>
There are only three parts of speech which can be used to make a
simple sentence in this manner, and these are, either the noun and the
verb, or the pronoun and the verb. We might say instead of <i>Men
work</i>, <i>They work</i>, and have a complete sentence.
</p>

<p>In the sentence <i>Men work</i>, <i>men</i> is the subject and
<i>work</i> is the predicate.
The subject and the predicate are the two principal elements
in a sentence. No sentence can be formed without these two parts
and these two parts can express a thought without the help of other
elements. Now we may begin to enlarge the subject by adding modifiers.
</p>

<p>You remember we have found that a noun may be modified by an
adjective. So we add the adjective <i>busy</i>, and we have:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Busy men work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our simple subject is still the noun <i>men</i>, but the complete
subject is the noun with its modifier, <i>busy men</i>. We may add other
adjectives and say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The busy, industrious men with families work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have our simple subject <i>men</i> modified by the adjectives,
<i>the</i>, <i>busy</i> and <i>industrious</i>, and also by the
adjective phrase, <i>with families</i>.
So the complete subject of the sentence now is, <i>the busy, industrious
men with families</i>.
</p>

<p>Our predicate is still the single verb <i>work</i>. Let us now enlarge
the predicate. We have found that adverbs are used to modify verbs,
and so we may say:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The busy, industrious men with families work hard.</li>
<li>The busy, industrious men with families work hard in the factory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our simple predicate, <i>work</i> is now enlarged. It is modified by the
adverb, <i>hard</i> and the adverb phrase, <i>in the factory</i>. So our
complete predicate is now, <i>work hard in the factory</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_404">404.</b> These sentences with the simple subject and the simple
predicate and their modifying words and phrases form simple sentences.
</p>

<p><b>A simple sentence is one which expresses a single statement,
question or command.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_405">405.</b> A simple sentence, therefore, will contain but one subject
and one predicate. The subject may be a compound subject and the
predicate may be a compound predicate, but still the sentence expresses
a single thought. For example: <i>The boys sing.</i> This is a simple
statement with a simple subject and a simple predicate. Then we may say:
<i>The boys sing and play.</i> We still have a single statement, but a
compound predicate, <i>sing and play</i>.
</p>

<p>Now we may make a compound subject, and say, <i>The boys and girls
sing and play</i>, but we have still a single statement, for both
predicates are asserted of both subjects. So, <i>The boys and girls sing and
play</i>, is a simple sentence.
</p>

<p>If we say, <i>The boys sing and the girls play</i>, we have a compound
sentence, composed of two simple sentences, <i>The boys sing</i>, <i>The
girls play</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_246" title="pg 246"></a>
If we say, <i>The boys sing while the girls play</i>, we have a complex
sentence formed of the simple sentence, <i>The boys sing</i>, and the
dependent clause, <i>while the girls play</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_406">406.</b> Now let us sum up our definitions:</p>

<p><b>Every sentence must contain two parts, a subject and a predicate.</b></p>

<p><b>The subject of a sentence is that part about which something is
said.</b></p>

<p><b>The predicate is that part which asserts something of the
subject.</b></p>

<p><b>The simple subject of a sentence is a noun, or the word used
in place of a noun, without modifiers.</b></p>

<p><b>The simple predicate is the verb or verb phrase without its
modifiers.</b></p>

<p><b>The complete subject of a sentence is the simple subject with
all of its modifiers.</b>
</p>
<p><b>The complete predicate of a sentence is the simple predicate
with all of its modifiers.</b></p>

<p><b>A simple sentence is one which expresses a single statement,
question or command.</b></p>

<p><b>A complex sentence is one containing an independent clause and
one or more dependent clauses.</b></p>

<p><b>A compound sentence is one containing two or more independent
clauses.</b></p>

<p><b>A clause is a part of a sentence containing a subject and a
predicate.</b></p>


<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the simple subject and the simple predicate
are printed in <i>italics</i>. Find all of the modifiers of the subject
and all of the modifiers of the predicate, and draw a single line under the
complete subject and two lines under the complete predicate.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Beautiful <i>pictures hang</i> on the wall.</li>
<li>Those elm <i>trees grow</i> rapidly every year.</li>
<li>A terrible <i>storm broke</i> unexpectedly at sea.</li>
<li>The clear, crystal <i>water runs</i> swiftly to the sea.</li>
<li>The beautiful <i>flowers fade</i> quickly in the heat.</li>
<li>The happy, boisterous <i>children play</i> at school every day.</li>
<li>The sturdy <i>oak</i> in the forest <i>stands</i> bravely through
every storm.</li>
<li>Their arching <i>tops</i> almost <i>speak</i> to us.</li>
<li>A <i>cry</i> of joy <i>rings</i> through the land.</li>
<li>The <i>leaves</i> of the trees <i>flutter</i> in the wind.</li>
<li>Great <i>clouds</i> of smoke <i>float</i> in the air.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_247" title="pg 247"></a>
Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Note carefully the following simple sentences. Each of these groups
of two words will suggest ideas and pictures to you. Lengthen each
sentence by adding modifiers to the simple subject and to the simple
predicate so as to make a fuller and more definite statement. For
example:
<i>Ships sail.</i> This is a simple subject and simple predicate. We
add adjectives and an adjective phrase and adverbs and an adverb
phrase as modifiers and we have, as follows:
</p>


<ul><li>The stately <i>ships</i> in the bay <i>sail</i> proudly away to foreign shores.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Snow melts.</li>
<li>Winds blow.</li>
<li>House stands.</li>
<li>Boys run.</li>
<li>Soldiers fight.</li>
<li>Tides flow.</li>
<li>Children play.</li>
<li>Ships sail.</li>
<li>Guns boom.</li>
<li>Women endure.</li>
</ul>


<h3>ANOTHER ELEMENT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_407">407.</b> You will note that all of these verbs which we have used in
these sentences have been complete verbs as <i>hang</i>, <i>grow</i>,
<i>runs</i>, <i>fade</i>, etc.
A complete verb, you will remember, is a verb that does not need an
object or a complement. It is complete within itself. It may be modified
by an adverb or an adverb phrase, but when you leave off these
modifiers you still have complete sense.
</p>

<p>In any of the sentences above you may cross out the adverb or the
adverb phrase which modifies the verb and you will still have complete
sentences. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Great clouds of smoke float in the air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the adverb phrase, <i>in the air</i>, may be omitted and still we
have complete sense, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Great clouds of smoke float.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_408">408.</b> The incomplete verbs, however, require either an object or
complement to complete their meaning.
</p>

<p>Incomplete verbs are of two kinds; those that express <i>action</i> and
those that express <i>state</i> or <i>condition</i>.
</p>

<p>An incomplete verb that expresses action requires an object which
is the receiver of the action expressed in the verb, so we have another
element which enters into the simple sentence, when we use an incomplete
verb. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The busy man makes shoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to complete the sentence, we must use an object with the
incomplete verb <i>makes</i>. To say, <i>The busy man makes</i>, is not
enough. We must have an object which is the receiver of the action expressed in
the verb, <i>makes</i>. Verbs of action often have two objects. One
object names the <i>thing</i> that <i>receives</i> the action and the other
names the <i>thing</i>
indirectly <i>affected</i> by the action. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The tailor made him a coat.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_248" title="pg 248"></a>
<b id="sec_409">409.</b> <i>Coat</i> is the <i>direct</i> object of the verb
<i>made</i>. But we have
another object in the pronoun <i>him</i>. We do not mean that the tailor
made <i>him</i>, but that the tailor made him a <i>coat</i>. <i>Coat</i>
is the direct object
and <i>him</i> is the indirect object. The indirect object is always
placed before the direct object. The indirect object may be used as the object
of the preposition <i>to</i> or <i>for</i>. As for example, this
sentence might be rewritten to read, <i>The tailor made a coat for him</i>. In this
sentence, <i>him</i> is not the indirect object of the verb, but is the object of
the preposition <i>for</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_410">410.</b> The direct object of the verb always answers the question
<i>what?</i> As for example, the tailor made <i>what?</i>&mdash;<i>a
coat</i>. The indirect object of the verb names the person or thing <i>to</i> or <i>for</i>
which the act is done,&mdash;<i>the tailor made a coat for whom?</i>&mdash;for <i>him</i>.
</p>

<p>The direct and indirect object become a part of the complete predicate
of the sentence. There may be other modifiers also, as adverbs
or adverb phrases, and all of these taken together form the complete
predicate in the sentences where you have used an incomplete verb.
As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The tailor gladly made him a coat for the occasion.</li>
</ul>

<p>The complete predicate is, <i>gladly made him a coat for the
occasion</i>, formed of the verb <i>made</i>, the direct object, <i>coat</i>, the
indirect object <i>him</i>,
the adverb modifier, <i>gladly</i>, and the phrase modifier, <i>for the
occasion</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, underscore the direct object with one
line and the indirect object with two lines. The verb is in italics.
</p>

<ol>
<li>He <i>gave</i> her a book.</li>
<li>He <i>wrote</i> me a long letter.</li>
<li>Her father <i>bought</i> her a watch.</li>
<li>The nurse <i>gave</i> the patient his medicine.</li>
<li>The mother <i>gave</i> her daughter a present.</li>
<li><i>Give</i> me time to think.</li>
<li>The clerk <i>sold</i> her a dress.</li>
<li>The teacher <i>read</i> the children a story.</li>
<li>The company <i>furnishes</i> the men food and shelter.</li>
<li>The man <i>showed</i> us his wounds.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>In the following sentences underscore the complete subject and the
complete predicate. Notice especially the direct and the indirect
objects of the incomplete verbs. The simple subjects and the direct objects
are in italics.
</p>
<ol>
<li>A great many <i>miles</i> separate <i>us</i> from our friends.</li>
<li>The merry <i>shouts</i> of the children fill the <i>air</i> with music.</li>
<li>A gentle <i>breeze</i> brings us the <i>perfume</i> of the flowers.</li>
<li>A careless <i>druggist</i> gave the unfortunate man the wrong <i>medicine</i>.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_249" title="pg 249"></a>
His admiring <i>friends</i> gave him a beautiful <i>ring</i>.</li>
<li><i>Soldiers</i> obey <i>orders</i> from their superiors.</li>
<li>This terrible <i>war</i> claims <i>thousands</i> of victims.</li>
<li>The <i>power</i> of hunger drives the <i>unemployed</i> to rebellion.</li>
<li>The <i>workers</i> of the world produce <i>enough</i> for all.</li>
<li>The retiring <i>secretary</i> showed us a <i>letter</i> from the president.</li>
<li>The old sea <i>captain</i> told them an interesting <i>story</i> of
life at sea.</li>
<li><i>Labor</i> produces all <i>wealth</i>.</li>
</ol>


<h3>COPULATIVE VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_411">411.</b> We have another class of incomplete verbs which require a
complement to complete their meaning. These are the copulative verbs.
The number of copulative verbs is small. They are: all forms of the
verb <i>be</i>; also, <i>like</i>, <i>appear</i>, <i>look</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>sound</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>become</i>, <i>seem</i>,
etc. These verbs require a noun or an adjective or a phrase as a complement,
to complete their meaning. They are really connective words
serving to connect the noun or adjective or phrase used in the predicate
with the noun which they modify. The noun or adjective or phrase
used to complete the meaning of the copulative verb is called a
predicate complement. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man is a hero.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have a noun, <i>hero</i>, used as a predicate complement after
the copulative verb, <i>is</i>, to describe the noun <i>man</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man is class-conscious.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, we have an adjective, <i>class-conscious</i>, in the
predicate to modify the subject, <i>man</i>. It is connected with the subject by
the copulative verb <i>is</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man is in earnest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have a phrase, <i>in earnest</i>, used in the predicate to
modify the noun <i>man</i>, and connected with the subject by the copulative
verb <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_412">412.</b>  So in the predicate with the copulative verbs&mdash;incomplete
verbs which express state or condition&mdash;we may use a noun or an
adjective or a phrase. A noun used as the predicate complement may have
modifiers. It may be modified by one or more adjectives or adjective
phrases. These adjectives in turn may be modified by adverbs. The
complete predicate, then, is the copulative verb with its predicate
complement and all its modifiers. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Grant was the most famous general of the Civil war.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>Grant</i> is the complete subject, <i>was the most
famous general of the Civil war</i> is the complete predicate. <i>Was</i> is
the copulative verb; <i>general</i> is the noun used as the predicate complement;
<i>the</i> and <i>famous</i> are adjectives modifying <i>general</i>; <i>most</i> is an
adverb modifying
<a class="pagenum" id="page_250" title="pg 250"></a>
the adjective <i>famous</i>, and, <i>of the Civil war</i> is an
adjective phrase modifying
<i>general</i>, so our complete predicate is, <i>was the most famous
general of the Civil war</i>.
</p>

<p>When an adjective is used in the predicate complement it, too, may
have modifiers and more than one adjective may be used. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man is very brave and loyal to his class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have two adjectives used in the predicate complement,
<i>brave</i> and <i>loyal</i>. <i>Brave</i> is modified by the adverb
<i>very</i>, and <i>loyal</i> is
modified by the adverb phrase, <i>to his class</i>. The complete
predicate is,
<i>is very brave and loyal to his class</i>.
</p>

<p>When we use a phrase as a predicate complement, it, too, may have
modifiers and more than one phrase may be used. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The man is in the fight and deeply in earnest.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, two phrases are used in the predicate complement,
<i>in the fight</i> and <i>in earnest</i>. The second phrase, <i>in

VERB PHRASES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_413">413.</b> Note that in most of the sentences which we have used, we
have used the simple form of the verb, the form that is used to express
<i>past</i> and <i>present</i> time. In expressing other time forms we
use verb phrases. Note the summary given in section 145, which gives the
different time forms of the verb.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_414">414.</b> Sometimes in using the verb phrase you will find that other
words may separate the words forming the phrase. When you analyze
your sentence this will not confuse you. You will easily be able to pick
out the verb phrase. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I shall very soon find out the trouble.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the adverbs, <i>very</i> and <i>soon</i>, separate <i>find</i> from
its auxiliary
<i>shall</i>. The verb phrase is, <i>shall find</i>. The negative
<i>not</i> very often
separates the words forming a verb phrase. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I will not go.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>will go</i> is the verb phrase.</p>

<p>When we use the auxiliary verb <i>do</i> to express emphasis, and also
the negative <i>not</i>, <i>not</i> comes between the auxiliary verb
<i>do</i>, and the principal verb. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not obey, I think.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>do obey</i> is the verb phrase.</p>

<p>In interrogative sentences, the verb phrase is inverted and a part of
the verb phrase is placed first and the subject after. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Will you go with us?</li>
</ul>

<p><i>You</i> is the subject of this interrogative sentence and <i>will go</i> is the
verb phrase; but in order to ask the question, the order is inverted and
part of the verb phrase placed first. In using interrogative adverbs in
asking a question, the same inverted order is used. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When will this work be commenced?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>work</i> is the subject of the sentence and <i>will be commenced</i>
is the verb phrase. If you should write this in assertive form, it would be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This work will be commenced when?</li>
</ul>

<p>By paying close attention we can easily distinguish the verb phrases
even when they are used in the inverted form or when they are separated
by other parts of speech.

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 24</h2>

<p>Among the common suffixes in English are the suffixes <i>or</i> and
<i>er</i>. These suffixes mean <i>one who</i> or <i>that which</i>. For example,
<i>builder</i>, one who builds; <i>actor</i>, one who acts; <i>heater</i>, that which heats.
But we are confused many times to know whether to add the suffix <i>or</i> or
<i>er</i> to form these derivative words. There is no exact rule which can be given, but
the following rule usually applies with but few exceptions:
</p>

<p>To the shorter and commoner words in the language add the suffix
<i>er</i>. For example, <i>writer</i>, <i>boxer</i>, <i>singer</i>, etc.
To the longer and less common words, usually those derived from the Latin or the Greek, add
the suffix <i>or</i>. For example, <i>legislator</i>, <i>conqueror</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>There are a number of words in the English like <i>honor</i>, in which the
last syllable used to be spelled <i>our</i> instead of <i>or</i>. You will probably run
across such words as these in your reading. This mode of spelling these words, however, is being rapidly dropped and the ending <i>or</i> is being
used instead of <i>our</i>. There are also a number of words in our language
like <i>center</i>, which used to be spelled with <i>re</i> instead of <i>er</i>. The <i>re</i> ending
is not used any more, although you may run across it occasionally
in your reading. The proper ending for all such words as these is
<i>er</i>. There are a few words, however, like <i>timbre</i> (a musical term) and
<i>acre</i>, which are still properly spelled with the <i>re</i> ending.
</p>

<p>The spelling lessons for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,
contain words from which derivatives can be formed by adding <i>er</i>
or <i>or</i>. Look these words up in the dictionary and be sure that you
have added the proper suffix. The list for Friday consists of words which
you may find in your reading spelled with the <i>our</i> ending. The
list for Saturday contains words which you may find spelled with the <i>re</i>
ending instead of the <i>er</i>.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 25</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>In logic, we have two ways of reasoning, from the general to the
particular and from the particular to the general. In other words, we
may take a certain number of facts and reason to a conclusion; or
we may go the other way about and start with our conclusion and reason
back to the facts which produce the conclusion. Scientists use the
former method. They gather together all the facts which they possibly can
and from these facts they reach their conclusions.
</p>

<p>This was what Karl Marx did for the social problems of his day.
He analyzed these problems. He gathered together all of the facts
which he could obtain concerning conditions of his day and from these
facts he reached certain conclusions. He foretold the rise of capitalism
and outlined present day conditions so perfectly that had he lived long
ago among superstitious people, they would probably have called him a
prophet.
</p>

<p>This mastery of analysis, of marshaling our facts and from them
reaching conclusions, is a wonderful power to possess, and this is
exactly what we are doing in our English work. We are analyzing our sentences,
finding the elements of which they are composed, and then building
the sentence; and since neither the thought nor the sentence can be
really studied except in connection with each other, this analysis of
sentences gives us an understanding of the thought. The effort to analyze
a difficult sentence leads to a fuller appreciation of the meaning of
the sentence. This, in turn, cultivates accuracy in our own thought and in
its expression.
</p>

<p>So do not slight the analysis of the sentence or this work in sentence
building. You will find it will help you to a quicker understanding of
that which you are reading and it will also give you a logical habit of
mind. You will be able to think more accurately and express yourself
more clearly. After a little practice in analysis you will find that in
your reading you will be able to grasp the author's meaning quickly. You
will see at a glance, without thinking about it consciously, the subject
and the predicate and the modifiers in the sentence. Then you will not
confuse the meaning. You will not have to go back and reread the passage
to find out just what the author was talking about; and when you come
to write and speak yourself, you will have formed the habit of logical
expression. In this way you will be able to put your thought in such a
manner that your listener can make no mistake as to just what you mean.
</p>

<p>Now, no habit comes without practice. You cannot do a thing
unconsciously until you have done it consciously a great many times.
So practice this analysis of sentences over and over. It really is an
interesting game in itself, and the results which it will bring to you are
tremendously worth while.
</p>

<p>Nothing is too much trouble which will give us the power to think
for ourselves and to put that thought into words.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_256" title="pg 256"></a>
THE SUBJECT OF A SIMPLE SENTENCE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_416">416.</b> We have found that the two parts of a simple sentence are
the complete subject and the complete predicate. The noun is most often
used as the subject of a sentence. It may have a number of modifiers,
but when we strip away these modifiers we can usually find a noun
which is the subject of the sentence. Occasionally the subject is a
pronoun or a participle or adjective used as a noun but most frequently
the subject is a noun. As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A wild piercing <i>cry</i> rang out.</li>
<li>Hopeless, helpless <i>children</i> work in the cotton mills.</li>
<li>The golden <i>age</i> of peace will come.</li>
<li>Little child <i>lives</i> are coined into money.</li>
<li>Defenseless, helpless <i>children</i> suffer most under capitalism.</li>
<li>Every neglected <i>child</i> smites my conscience in the name of humanity.</li>
<li>The thrilling, far-sounding <i>battle-cry</i> shall resound.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in all of these sentences the word in italics is a noun,
which is the simple subject of the sentence. All of the other words
which comprise the complete subject are the modifiers of this noun, or
modifiers of its modifiers.
</p>

<p>But in our study of words, we have found that there are a number
of other words which can be used in place of a noun and these may all
be used as the subject of a sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_417">417.</b> <b>A pronoun may be used as the subject of a sentence</b>,
for the pronoun is a word used in place of the noun; and a pronoun
used as the subject of a sentence may have modifiers just as a noun. It
may be modified by adjectives or adjective phrases, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>We</i> are confident of success.</li>
<li><i>He</i>, worried and out of employment, committed suicide.</li>
<li><i>She</i>, heartsick and weary, waited for an answer.</li>
<li><i>She</i>, with her happy, watchful ways, blessed the household.</li>
<li><i>They</i>, victorious and triumphant, entered the city.</li>
<li>How can <i>I</i>, without money or friends, succeed?</li>
</ul>

<div class="poem left">
<p>"Out of the night that covers me,</p>
<p>Black as the pit from pole to pole,</p>
<p><i>I</i> thank whatever Gods there be</p>
<p>For my unconquerable soul."</p>
</div>

<p>In all of these sentences the pronoun is the simple subject of the
sentence, and the pronoun with all of its modifiers is the complete
subject of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_418">418.</b> <b>The participle may be used as a noun, the subject of the
sentence.</b>  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Traveling</i> is pleasant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the present participle <i>traveling</i> is used as a noun, subject
of the sentence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_257" title="pg 257"></a>
Participle phrases may also be used as nouns, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Being prepared</i> will not save us from war.</li>
<li>His <i>having signed</i> the note was the cause of the trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these sentences, <i>being prepared</i> and <i>having signed</i> are
participle phrases used as nouns, the subjects of the verbs <i>will save</i> and
<i>was</i>. Note the use of the participle used as the subject in the following
sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Painting</i> is an art.</li>
<li><i>Making</i> shoes is his work.</li>
<li><i>Being discovered</i> seems to be the real crime.</li>
<li>His <i>having joined</i> his comrades was a brave act.</li>
<li>Your <i>remaining</i> here will be dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that when the participle is used as a noun, the possessive form
of the pronoun is always used with it, as in the sentence above:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Your</i> remaining here will be dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that in some of these sentences the participle has an object;
as, making <i>shoes</i>, his having joined his <i>comrades</i>. The
participle still retains some of its verb nature in that it may take an object. The
entire phrases, <i>His having joined his comrades</i>, and, <i>Making
shoes</i>, are the subjects of the sentences.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_419">419.</b> <b>The infinitive may also be used as a noun, the subject
of the sentence.</b> Note in the following sentences the use of the
infinitive as the subject of the sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>To err</i> is human; <i>to forgive</i> is divine.</li>
<li><i>To be</i> or not <i>to be</i> is the question.</li>
<li><i>To toil</i> all day is wearisome.</li>
<li><i>To aim</i> is one thing; <i>to hit</i> the mark is another.</li>
<li><i>To remain</i> ignorant is to remain a slave.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_420">420.</b> <b>An adjective can also be used as the subject.</b> You
remember in our study of adjectives we found that an adjective may be used
as a noun, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>strong</i> enslave the weak.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the adjective <i>strong</i> is used as a noun, subject of the
sentence. Note in the following sentences, the use of the adjectives as subjects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>wise</i> instruct the ignorant.</li>
<li>The <i>dead</i> were left upon the battlefields.</li>
<li>The <i>rich</i> look down upon the poor.</li>
<li>The <i>mighty</i> of the earth have forced this war upon us.</li>
<li>The <i>poor</i> are enslaved by their ignorance.</li>
<li>The <i>wounded</i> were carried to the hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_258" title="pg 258"></a>
PLACE OF THE SUBJECT IN A SENTENCE</h3>

<p>The subject usually comes first in the sentence. If it has any
modifiers, they alone precede the subject, as for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A wonderful, inspiring <i>lecture</i> was given.</li>
<li>The weary <i>army</i> slept in the trenches.</li>
</ul>

<p>But occasionally we find the subject after the verb.</p>

<p><b id="sec_421">421.</b> <b>By simple inversion.</b></p>

<p>We will often find this use in poetry or in poetic prose, as for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never have <i>I</i> heard one word to the contrary.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence <i>I</i> is the subject of the sentence, <i>have
heard</i> is the verb, and <i>never</i> is an adverb modifying the verb phrase, <i>have
heard</i>. But in order to place emphasis upon the word <i>never</i>, which is the
emphatic word in the sentence, <i>never</i> is placed first, and the verb phrase
inverted so that the subject <i>I</i> comes in between the two words which form
the verb phrase. The sentence expressed in its usual order would be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I have never heard one word to the contrary.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will note that this statement does not carry the same emphasis
upon the word <i>never</i> as the inverted statement.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_422">422.</b> <b>In interrogative sentences, the subject comes after the
helping verb or after the interrogative used to introduce the
sentence.</b> As for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have <i>you</i> heard the news?</li>
<li>When will <i>we</i> hear from you?</li>
<li>How have the <i>people</i> been managing?</li>
<li>What will the <i>children</i> do then?</li>
<li>Will the <i>students</i> come later?</li>
<li>Can the <i>work</i> be accomplished quickly?</li>
<li>Must our <i>youth</i> end so quickly?</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_423">423.</b> <b>The real subject comes after the verb when we use the
introductory word <i>it</i>.</b> As for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It will not be safe <i>to go</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>To go</i> is really the subject of the sentence. <i>To go will not be
safe.</i></p>

<p><i>It</i> is sometimes the real subject of a sentence, as in the
sentence; <i>It is a wonderful story.</i>
</p>
<p>Here <i>it</i> is the subject of the sentence and <i>a wonderful
story</i> is the predicate complement. But in the sentence:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It is wonderful to hear him tell the story.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>To hear him tell the story</i> is the real subject of the sentence.
The first sentence, <i>It is a wonderful story</i>, could not be rewritten,
but the second sentence could be rewritten, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To hear him tell the story is wonderful.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_259" title="pg 259"></a>
<b id="sec_424">424.</b> <b>The introductory word <i>there</i> reverses the order of
the sentence</b>, just as the introductory word <i>it</i>. The real subject
is used later in the sentence. As for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There were a great many people present.</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be rewritten, omitting the introductory word <i>there</i>. We
could say:</p>

<ul>
<li>A great many people were present.</li>
</ul>

<p>The noun <i>people</i> is the subject of the sentence.</p>


<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, underscore the complete subject with
one line, and the simple subject with two lines, and decide whether the
simple subject is a noun, pronoun, participle, infinitive or an
adjective used as a noun:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A great man is universal and elemental.</li>
<li>To love justice was his creed.</li>
<li>A more inspiring and noble declaration of faith was never born
of human heart.</li>
<li>The reading of good books should begin in childhood.</li>
<li>Dreaming of great things will not bring us to the goal.</li>
<li>The weary seek for rest.</li>
<li>To believe in yourself is the first essential.</li>
<li>He, speaking and writing constantly for the cause, has given
his life to the movement.</li>
<li>To remain ignorant is to remain a slave.</li>
<li>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.</li>
<li>A great soul has simply nothing to do with consistency.</li>
<li>To be great is to be misunderstood.</li>
<li>Traveling is a fool's paradise.</li>
<li>It is not enough to be sincere.</li>
<li>We, seeking the truth, have found our own.</li>
<li>There are thousands of comrades with us.</li>
</ol>


<h3>THE COMPLETE PREDICATE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_425">425.</b> Look first in the predicate for your verb. It will always be
the principal part of your predicate. It may be a verb or a verb phrase,
but the first thing in analyzing the complete predicate of the sentence
is to find the verb. The verb or verb phrase without any of its modifiers
constitutes the simple predicate. If the verb is a complete verb, its
only modifiers will be adverbs or adverb phrases. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A splendid statue of Lincoln stands yonder in the park.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, <i>stands yonder in the park</i> is the complete
predicate.
<i>Stands</i> is a complete verb. It requires no object, but it is
modified by
the adverb <i>yonder</i> and by the adverb phrase <i>in the park</i>.</p>


<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_260" title="pg 260"></a>
INCOMPLETE VERBS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_426">426.</b> If the verb in the predicate is an incomplete verb of
action, then the object of the verb is also part of the predicate. The complete
predicate containing an incomplete verb of action may contain five
parts; a verb, a direct object, an indirect object, an adverb and an adverb
phrase. As for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The tailor gladly made him a coat at that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, the complete predicate is <i>gladly made him a coat
at that time</i>. <i>Made</i> is the verb. It is an incomplete verb of
action, and <i>coat</i> is its direct object. <i>Him</i> is the indirect object.
<i>Made</i> is also modified
by the adverb <i>gladly</i>, and the adverb phrase, <i>at that time</i>.
</p>

<p>All of these are not always used, of course, in every predicate; but
these are the elements which may occur in the predicate with an
incomplete verb.
</p>

<h3>THE OBJECT OF THE VERB</h3>

<p><b id="sec_427">427.</b> Words used as objects of a verb are practically the same as
those which may be used for its subject.
</p>

<p><b>We may have a noun used as the object of the verb.</b> For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hail destroyed the <i>crops</i>.</li>
<li>The banks rob the <i>farmers</i>.</li>
<li>We must educate the <i>children</i>.</li>
<li>Labor produces all <i>wealth</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, <i>crops</i>, <i>farmers</i>, <i>children</i> and
<i>wealth</i> are nouns used as the object of the verb.
</p>

<p><b>A pronoun may also be used as the object of a verb.</b> For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will you not teach <i>me</i>?</li>
<li>Send <i>them</i> to her.</li>
<li>They have invited <i>us</i>.</li>
<li>The comrades will remember <i>him</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above sentences, <i>me</i>, <i>them</i>, <i>us</i> and <i>him</i> are the objects of the
verbs, <i>will teach</i>, <i>send</i>, <i>have invited</i> and <i>will remember</i>.
</p>

<p>Remember that in pronouns we have a different form for the object
form, as, <i>me</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>us</i> and <i>them</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_428">428.</b> <b>An infinitive may also be used as the object of a
verb</b>, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I like <i>to study</i>.</li>
<li>He asked <i>to go</i>.</li>
<li>I want <i>to learn</i> all that I can.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this last sentence, the infinitive, <i>to learn</i>, is the direct object of
the verb <i>want</i>. The object of the infinitive, <i>to learn</i>, is
<i>all that I can</i>.
All of this taken together with the verb <i>want</i>, forms the complete
predicate, <i>want to learn all that I can</i>.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_261" title="pg 261"></a>
<b id="sec_429">429.</b> <b>The participle may also be used as the object of a
verb</b>, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We heard the <i>thundering</i> of the cannon.</li>
<li>We enjoyed the <i>dancing</i>.</li>
<li>Do you hear the <i>singing</i> of the birds?</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences, the participles <i>thundering</i>, <i>dancing</i>, and <i>singing</i>
are the objects of the verbs <i>heard</i>, <i>enjoyed</i> and <i>do hear</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_430">430.</b> <b>An adjective used as a noun may also be used as the
object of a verb</b>, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw the <i>rich</i> and the <i>poor</i> struggling together.</li>
<li>The struggle for existence crushes the <i>weak</i>.</li>
<li>Seek the <i>good</i> and the <i>true</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the adjectives <i>rich</i>, <i>poor</i>, <i>weak</i>,
<i>good</i> and <i>true</i>,
are used as nouns and are the objects of the verbs <i>saw</i>,
<i>crushes</i> and <i>seek</i>.
</p>

<h3>VERBS OF STATE OR CONDITION</h3>

<p>We have found that with the incomplete verbs of state or condition,
or copulative verbs, the predicate complement may be either a
noun, as, <i>The man is a hero</i>; or an adjective, as, <i>The man is
class-conscious</i>; or a phrase, as, <i>The man is in earnest</i>.
</p>
<ul><li>The predicate complement may also be:</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_431">431.</b> <b>A pronoun</b>; as,</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is she?</li>
<li>That was he.</li>
<li>This is I.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these sentences the subjects of the verbs are <i>she</i>, <i>that</i>
and <i>this</i>,
and the pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>he</i> and <i>I</i> are used as
predicate complements.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_432">432.</b> <b>Infinitives may also be used as the predicate
complement</b>, thus:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To remain ignorant is <i>to remain</i> a slave.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>To remain ignorant</i>, is the subject of the copulative verb
<i>is</i>, and the
infinitive, <i>to remain</i>, with its complement, <i>a slave</i>, is
the predicate complement.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_433">433.</b> <b>A participle used as a noun may also be used as the
predicate complement</b>, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Society is the mingling of many elements.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mingling</i>, in this sentence is a participle of the verb <i>mingle</i>, but is
used as a noun, the predicate complement of the verb <i>is</i>.
<i>Society</i> is the subject of the verb.
</p>

<p>Where the present participle is used to form a verb phrase, the
participle is part of the verb phrase, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We are mingling in society.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_262" title="pg 262"></a>
Here, <i>are mingling</i>, is the present progressive verb phrase, and
the participle <i>mingling</i> is not used as a noun or adjective, but is
part of the verb phrase <i>are mingling</i>.
</p>

<p>If you will observe the different parts of speech carefully, you will
not be easily confused as to whether the participle is a noun or a part
of the verb phrase.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the incomplete verbs, including infinitives
and participles, are in italics. Mark the words, phrases or clauses
which are used as objects or complements, to complete the meaning of these
verbs.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There <i>is</i> no such thing in America as an independent press, unless
it <i>is</i> in the country towns.</p>

<p>You <i>have</i> it and I <i>know</i> it.
There <i>is</i> not one of you who <i>dares to write</i> his
honest opinions. If you did, you <i>know</i> beforehand that it would
never appear in print.</p>

<p>I <i>am paid</i> $150.00 a week for <i>keeping</i> my honest opinions
out of the paper with which I am connected. Others of you <i>are paid</i> similar
salaries for similar things. Any one of you who <i>would be</i> so foolish as <i>to write</i>
his honest opinions <i>would be</i> out on the streets looking for another job.</p>

<p>The business of the New York journalist <i>is to destroy</i> the truth,
to lie outright, to pervert, to villify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and
<i>to sell</i> his race and his country for his daily bread.</p>

<p>You <i>know</i> this and I <i>know</i> it. So what folly <i>is</i> this
<i>to be toasting</i> an "Independent Press."</p>

<p>We <i>are</i> the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We
<i>are</i> the jumping-jacks; they <i>pull</i> the strings and we dance. Our talents,
our possibilities and our lives <i>are</i> all the property of other men. We <i>are</i>
intellectual prostitutes.<span class="author">&mdash;<i>John Swinton.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>


<h3>MODIFIERS OF THE SIMPLE SENTENCE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_434">434.</b> Remember that a simple sentence is one that contains a
single statement, question or command. It is a clause, for it contains
a subject and a predicate; but it contains only the one subject and the
one predicate. A sentence containing two principal clauses, or a
principal clause and a subordinate clause, would contain two complete statements,
questions or commands, therefore it would not be a simple sentence,
but compound or complex.
</p>

<p>Remember, however, that the simple sentences may contain two or
more subjects with the same predicate, or two or more predicates with
the same subject, or both a compound subject and a compound predicate.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_435">435.</b> The modifiers in a simple sentence are always words or
phrases. The modifiers of the subject are either adjectives or adjective
phrases. The modifiers of the predicate are either adverbs or adverb
phrases. If an adjective or an adverb clause is used as a modifier, then
the sentence is no longer a simple sentence, but becomes a <i>complex</i>
sentence, for it now contains a dependent clause.
</p>


<h3>ORDER OF ELEMENTS<a class="pagenum" id="page_263" title="pg 263"></a></h3>

<p><b id="sec_436">436.</b> The usual order of the principal elements in the sentence is
the subject, the predicate and the object or complement, thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="sub">Subject</th>    <th colspan="2" align="left" class="sub">Predicate</th></tr>
<tr>  <td><i>Men</i></td>         <td colspan="2" align="left"><i>work</i></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><th class="sub">Subject</th>    <th class="sub">Predicate</th>   <th class="sub">Object</th></tr>
<tr>  <td><i>Men</i></td>        <td><i>build</i></td>      <td><i>houses</i></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><th class="sub">Subject</th>    <th class="sub">Predicate</th>    <th class="sub">Complement</th></tr>
<tr> <td><i>Books</i></td>        <td><i>are</i></td>         <td><i>helpful</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is called the natural or logical order. Logical means according
to sense or reason.</p>

<p>Adjectives usually stand before the nouns they modify, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Good</i> books are helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adverbs may be placed either before or after the verbs they modify, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The men <i>then</i> came <i>quickly</i> to the rescue.</li>
</ul>

<p>The adverb <i>then</i> precedes the verb <i>came</i>, which it modifies;
and the adverb <i>quickly</i> is placed after the verb.
</p>

<p>Adverbs which modify adjectives or other adverbs are placed before
the words which they modify, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>more</i> industrious students learn <i>quite</i> rapidly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, the adverb <i>more</i> is placed before the adjective
<i>industrious</i>, which it modifies; and the adverb <i>quite</i> is
placed before the adverb <i>rapidly</i>, which it modifies.
</p>

<p>Adjective and adverb phrases usually follow the words which they
modify, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The men <i>in the car</i> came quickly <i>to the rescue</i>.</li>
<li>The manager <i>of the mine</i> remained <i>with the men</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this last sentence, the adjective phrase, <i>of the mine</i>, is
placed after the noun <i>manager</i>, which it modifies, and the
adverb phrase, <i>with the men</i>, is placed after the verb <i>remained</i>, which it
modifies.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_437">437.</b> These sentences illustrate the logical order in which the
elements of the sentence usually come. But this logical order is not
strictly adhered to. Many times, in order to place the emphasis upon
certain words, we reverse this order and place the emphasized words
first, as:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Without your help</i>, we cannot win.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_264" title="pg 264"></a>
The logical order of this sentence is:</p>

<ul>
<li>We cannot win without your help.</li>
</ul>

<p>But we want to place the emphasis upon <i>your help</i>, so we change
the order of the words and place the phrase, <i>without your help</i>,
first.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_438">438.</b> This inversion of the order helps us to express our thought
with more emphasis. Our language is so flexible that we can express
the same thought in different ways by simply changing the order of the
elements in the sentence. Notice in the following sentences, the inversion
of the usual order, and see what difference this makes in the expression
of the thought.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.</li>
<li>A more terrible scene you cannot imagine.</li>
<li>With the shrieking of shot and shell the battle raged.</li>
<li>Louder and louder thundered the tempest.</li>
<li>Silently and sadly the men returned to their homes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To transpose these inverted sentences&mdash;that is to place the elements
in their logical order, gives us an insight into the thought expressed in
the sentence. It is worth a great deal to us to be able in our reading to
see the live elements in the sentence at a glance, and in this way we can
grasp at once the thought of the sentence. So you will find that this
analyzing of the sentences is very helpful to us in our reading.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_439">439.</b> When we have learned to analyze a sentence quickly we will
not be lost in the maze of words. A paragraph is often like a string of
pearls. The author has a single thread of thought running through
the different sentences which compose the paragraph and if we have
trained ourselves well in sentence analysis, we will never lose this thread.
It will be like a life line to which we cling while the breakers of thought
and emotion roar about us.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>In the following poem, study carefully the inverted order of the
sentences. Rewrite them, placing the elements in their logical order.
As for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To the poor man you've been true from of old.</li>
</ul>

<p>The elements of the sentence are inverted in this quotation. Rewritten
in their logical order this would read:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You've been true to the poor man from of old.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will note that this inversion is quite common in poetry.</p>

<h2>SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 25</h2>

<p>You remember in our lesson in the study of consonants we found
there were a number of consonants in English which had more than one
sound; for example, <i>c</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>x</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>A number of other consonants have sounds which are similar;
that is, they are made with the organs of articulation in the same
position, only one is a soft, and the other a hard sound; for example, <i>p</i>
and <i>b</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>d</i>, <i>f</i> and <i>v</i>, etc. These
sounds are called cognate sounds. Cognate
means literally <i>of the same nature</i>, and so these sounds are of
the same nature, only in one the obstruction of the vocal organs is more
complete than in the other.
</p>

<p>Our language contains a number of words in which there is a difference
in the pronunciation of the final consonant when the word is used
as a noun and as a verb. The final consonants in these words are the
cognate sounds, <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>; <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>; <i>th</i> soft
or <i>th</i> hard, <i>s</i> soft, or <i>s</i> hard. When
the consonant sound is a soft sound, the word is a noun; and when the
consonant sound is a hard sound the word is a verb. For example;
<i>use</i> and <i>use</i>; <i>breath</i> and <i>breathe</i>; <i>life</i> and
<i>live</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_266" title="pg 266"></a>
The spelling lessons for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday contain
words ending in cognate sounds, in which the words ending with a soft
sound are nouns and the words ending in the hard sounds are verbs.
Add others to this list as they occur to you.
</p>

<p>We have a number of words in the English beginning with <i>ex</i>. In
some of these words, the <i>ex</i> has the sound of <i>eks</i>, and in
some of the words the <i>ex</i> has the sound of <i>egs</i>. It is not easy at times
to know which sound to use.
</p>

<p>In regard to the use of <i>ex</i>, follow this rule: When a word
beginning with <i>ex</i> is followed by an accented syllable beginning with a
vowel, the <i>ex</i> is pronounced <i>egs</i>; in all other words <i>ex</i> is
pronounced <i>eks</i>; for example,
in <i>executor</i>, the <i>ex</i> is followed by an accented syllable
beginning with a vowel, therefore, <i>ex</i> is pronounced <i>egs</i>. In
<i>execute</i>, the <i>ex</i> is followed
by an unaccented syllable beginning with a vowel, and therefore
<i>ex</i> is pronounced <i>eks</i>. In <i>explain</i>, <i>ex</i> is
followed by a syllable beginning
with a consonant, and it is therefore pronounced <i>eks</i>.
</p>

<p>Note that in words like <i>exhibit</i>, <i>exhort</i>, etc., the
<i>ex</i> is followed by a
vowel sound, the <i>h</i> being silent, and it is therefore, pronounced
<i>egs</i>, for it is followed by an accented syllable beginning with a vowel sound.
</p>

<p>The spelling list for Thursday, Friday and Saturday contains words
beginning with <i>ex</i>. Watch carefully the pronunciation.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 26</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>There are really two things which will come to us out of the study
of grammar. One of these, which we discussed in our letter last week,
is the power of logical thinking. The second is the ability to express
our thoughts correctly; that is, according to accepted usage. So you
can consider your spoken and written speech from two viewpoints.
First, you can look to see if you have used the words correctly. We
have noted these common errors especially in our study of the various
parts of speech. There are certain errors we often make, as for example,
using a plural noun with a singular verb, or using the past time form of
the verb for the past participle.
</p>

<p>We have noted a great many of these errors in our speech. We
might make ourselves understood and express ourselves fairly accurately
and still make these mistakes, but it is wise for us to try to eliminate
them from our speech for several reasons. To those who understand
the use of correct English, these mistakes mark us as ignorant and
uneducated. No matter how important and absolutely accurate the thought
we are expressing, if we make these grammatical errors, they very
naturally discount our thought also. They feel that if we cannot speak
correctly, in all probability we cannot think accurately, either.
</p>

<p>Then, too, these words in our speech distract the attention of our
hearers from the things which we are saying. It is like the mannerism
of an actor. If he has any peculiar manner of walking or of talking
and persists in carrying that into whatever character he is
interpreting, we always see the actor himself, instead of the character which he is
portraying. His mannerisms get in the way and interfere with our
grasp of the idea.
</p>

<p>So in music. You may be absorbed in a wonderful selection which
some one is playing and if suddenly he strikes a wrong note, the discord
distracts your attention and perhaps you never get back into the spirit
of the music again.
</p>

<p>So we must watch these common errors in our speech, but we must
not let our study of English be simply that alone. The greatest benefit
which we are deriving from this study is the analytic method of thought
and the logical habit of mind, which the effort to express ourselves
clearly and accurately and in well-chosen words will give us. Put as
much time as you can possibly spare into this analysis of sentences.
Take your favorite writer and analyze his sentences and find out what is
his particular charm for you. If there is any sentence which gives you
a little trouble and you cannot analyze it properly, copy it in your
next examination paper and state where the difficulty lies. Rewrite the
passages which please you most and then compare your version with the
author's and see if you really grasped his meaning. In this way you
will add quickly to your enjoyment of the writing of others and to your
power of expressing yourself.

THE SIMPLE SENTENCE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_440">440.</b> We have been analyzing the simple sentence, which contains
only words and phrases. We have found that there may enter into the
simple sentence, the following elements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The simple subject.</li>
<li>The simple predicate.</li>
<li>The modifiers of the subject.</li>
<li>The object of the verb.</li>
<li>The predicate complement.</li>
<li>The modifiers of the predicate.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not the order in which the elements will appear in the sentence,
but this is the order of their importance. We first look for the
simple subject and the simple predicate; then we can determine which
words are the modifiers of the subject; then we find the object or
predicate complement of the verb and the modifiers of the verb; and thus
we have all of the elements which go into the construction of the simple sentence.
</p>

<p>We may also have two nouns used as the subject or two verbs
used in the predicate, connected by a co-ordinate conjunction, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Marx and Engels lived and worked together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have two proper nouns used as the subject, <i>Marx</i> and
<i>Engels</i>. We have also two verbs used as the predicate,
<i>lived</i> and <i>worked</i>.
We call this a compound subject and compound predicate.
</p>

<p>So in one simple sentence, that is a sentence which makes a single
assertion, we may have every part of speech. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The most intelligent men and women think for themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, we have a <i>noun</i>, <i>verb</i>, <i>pronoun</i>, <i>adjective</i>, <i>adverb</i>,
<i>conjunction</i> and <i>preposition</i>&mdash;every part of speech except the <i>interjection</i>,
which is an independent element and does not enter into the construction of the sentence.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Write simple sentences of your own containing:</p>

<ol>
<li>A compound subject.</li>
<li>A compound predicate.</li>
<li>A noun as subject modified by one or more adjectives.</li>
<li>A noun as subject modified by a phrase.</li>
<li>An incomplete verb with a direct and an indirect object.</li>
<li>An incomplete verb with a predicate complement.</li>
<li>A predicate modified by one or more adverbs.</li>
<li>A predicate modified by an adverb phrase.</li>
</ol>


<h3>COMPLEX SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_441">441.</b> The simple sentence is the unit of speech. It is a combination
of words which makes a single statement, question or command. But
many times a constant repetition of these short sentences would become
tiresome, and our written and spoken speech would not flow as smoothly
and rapidly as we desire. So we have evolved a way in which we may
combine these sentences into longer statements. Let us take the two
<i>simple</i> sentences:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_269" title="pg 269"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>We are united.</li>
<li>We shall succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may combine these into a single sentence by using the co-ordinate
conjunction <i>and</i>. Then our sentence reads:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We are united and we shall succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a <i>compound</i> sentence, formed by uniting two simple sentences.
Both of the clauses are independent and are of equal rank.
Neither depends upon the other. They are united by the co-ordinate
conjunction <i>and</i>. We can combine these sentences in a different way.
For example, we may say:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If we are united, we shall succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have a subordinate clause, <i>if we are united</i>, which is used
to modify the verb of the main clause, <i>succeed</i>. We have used the subordinate
conjunction <i>if</i>, and so we have a <i>complex</i> sentence formed by
uniting the principal clause and a dependent clause.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_442">442.</b> The next step in sentence building, after the simple sentence,
is the complex sentence. A complex sentence is a combination of two
or more simple sentences, which are so united that one sentence remains
the main sentence&mdash;the backbone, as it were&mdash;and the other sentence
becomes subordinate or dependent upon it.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_443">443.</b> <b>A complex sentence is one containing a principal clause
and one or more subordinate clauses.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A principal clause is one which makes a complete statement
without the help of any other clause or clauses.</b>
</p>

<p><b>A subordinate or dependent clause is one which makes a statement
dependent upon or modifying some word or words in the
principal clause.</b>
</p>

<h3>KINDS OF DEPENDENT CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_444">444.</b> Dependent clauses are of three kinds. They may be used
either as <i>nouns</i>, <i>adjectives</i> or <i>adverbs</i>, and so are
called <i>noun clauses</i>, <i>adjective clauses</i> or <i>adverb clauses</i>.
</p>

<h3>NOUN CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_445">445.</b> <b>Noun clauses are those which are used in place of a
noun.</b> They may be used in any way in which a noun may be used, except as
a possessive.
</p>

<p>1. <b>The noun clause may be used as the subject of the sentence.</b>
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>That he is innocent</i> is admitted by all.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clause, <i>that he is innocent</i> is used as a <i>noun</i>, the
subject of the sentence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_270" title="pg 270"></a>
2. <b>The noun clause may be used as the object of a verb</b>, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>I admit <i>that I cannot understand your argument</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clause, <i>that I cannot understand your argument</i>, is in this
sentence the object of the verb <i>admit</i>.</p>

<p>3. <b>The noun clause may be used as the predicate complement</b>, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fact is <i>that this policy will never win</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clause, <i>that this policy will never win</i>, is here used in the
predicate with the copulative verb <i>is</i>.
</p>
<p>4. <b>The noun clause may also be used in apposition, explaining
the noun with which it is used</b>, thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The motion, <i>that the question should be reconsidered</i>, was carried.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>That the question should be reconsidered</i>, is here a noun clause,
used in apposition with the noun <i>motion</i>, and explains the meaning
of the noun.</p>

<p>5. <b>The noun clause may also be used as the object of a
preposition</b>, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>I now refer to <i>what he claims</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The noun clause, <i>what he claims</i>, is here the object of the
preposition, <i>to</i>.</p>


<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the noun clauses are printed in italics.
Determine whether they are used as the subject, or object of the verb,
as predicate complement, in apposition, or as the object of a
preposition.</p>

<ol>
<li>The fact is <i>that I was not listening</i>.</li>
<li><i>Whatever King Midas looked upon</i> turned to gold.</li>
<li>He acknowledged <i>what we had suspected</i>.</li>
<li>We will never know <i>what the real situation was</i>.</li>
<li>The fact <i>that the wage is insufficient</i> can be easily proved.</li>
<li>He replied to <i>what had been asked</i>.</li>
<li>The claim was <i>that he had made a speech inciting to riot</i>.</li>
<li>The law <i>that labor unions are in restraint of trade</i> was upheld.</li>
<li><i>That we cannot win by compromise</i> is readily apparent.</li>
<li>Labor demands <i>that it shall have its full product</i>.</li>
<li><i>Whoever controls education</i> controls the future.</li>
<li>He came to <i>where the militia was in camp</i>.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Write sentences containing noun clauses used:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the subject of a verb.</li>
<li>As the object of a verb.</li>
<li>As a predicate complement.</li>
<li>In apposition.</li>
<li>As the object of a preposition.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_271" title="pg 271"></a>
ADJECTIVE CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_446">446.</b> A dependent clause in a complex sentence may also be an
adjective clause.</p>

<p><b>An adjective clause is a clause used as an adjective</b>, and, hence,
always modifies a noun or some word used as a noun, such as a pronoun
or a participle. In Lesson 22, we studied adjective clauses and found
that they could be introduced by the relative pronouns, <i>who</i>,
<i>which</i>, <i>that</i>
and <i>as</i>, and also by conjunctions such as, <i>when</i>,
<i>where</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>whence</i>,
etc. An adjective clause may modify any noun or any word used as a
noun in the sentence.
</p>
<p>1. <b>An adjective clause may modify the subject</b>, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Men <i>who have become class-conscious</i> do not make good soldiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence the clause, <i>who have become class-conscious</i>,
modifies the noun <i>men</i>, and is introduced by the relative pronoun <i>who</i>.</p>

<p>2. <b>An adjective clause may modify the noun which is the object
of the verb</b>, as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The men supported the <span class="corr" title="italics removed">party</span> <i>which fought for their rights</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the clause, <i>which fought for their rights</i>, is an adjective
clause introduced by the pronoun <i>which</i>, and it modifies the noun
<i>party</i>, which is the object of the verb <i>supported</i>.
</p>

<p>3. <b>An adjective clause may also be used to modify the noun
which is used in the predicate complement</b>, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>That was the book <i>which I enjoyed</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence the clause, <i>which I enjoyed</i>, is an adjective
clause modifying the noun <i>book</i>, which is used as the predicate
complement with the copulative verb <i>was</i>.
</p>

<p>4. <b>An adjective clause may also be used to modify the noun
which is used as the object of a preposition</b>, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He arrived on the train <i>which was late</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here the adjective clause, <i>which was late</i>, modifies the noun
<i>train</i>, which is the object of the preposition <i>on</i>.
</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a little difficult to discover these adjective clauses,
for frequently the connecting word is omitted, as for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I could not find the man <i>I wanted</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sentence, the pronoun <i>whom</i> is omitted; the complete
sentence would read:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I could not find the man <i>whom I wanted</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Whom I wanted</i> is an adjective clause modifying the noun <i>man</i>.</p>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the relative pronouns and the conjunctions
introducing adjective clauses are omitted. Rewrite the sentences
using the proper relative pronouns and conjunctions. The adjective
clauses are in italics.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The people <i>you are seeking</i> are not here.</li>
<li>I have read the book <i>you brought</i>.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_272" title="pg 272"></a>
The articles <i>you mentioned</i> are not listed.</li>
<li>I will go to the place <i>you say</i>.</li>
<li>This is a book <i>you should read</i>.</li>
<li>Those are ideals <i>the people will readily grasp</i>.</li>
<li>We make Gods of the things <i>we fear</i>.</li>
<li>I listened to every word <i>he said</i>.</li>
<li>I should love the cause <i>you love</i>.</li>
<li>The things <i>the people demand</i> are just and right.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>In the following sentences the adjective clauses are all printed in
italics. Determine whether they modify the subject or the object, the
predicate complement or the object of the preposition.
</p>
<ol>
<li>In that moment <i>when he saw the light</i> he joined our cause.</li>
<li>Other men are lenses <i>through which we read our own minds</i>.</li>
<li>This is perhaps the reason <i>why we are unable to agree</i>.</li>
<li>He <i>that loveth</i> maketh his own the grandeur <i>that he loves</i>.</li>
<li>The other terror <i>that scares us from self-trust</i> is our consistency.</li>

<li>There is a popular fable of a sot <i>who was picked up dead drunk
in the street, carried to the Duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in
the Duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all ceremony like a duke
and assured that he had been insane</i>.
</li>
<li>He <i>who would gather immortal palms</i> must not be hindered by
the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness.</li>

<li>Superstition, <i>who is the mother of fear and faith</i>, still rules
many people.</li>

<li>We are looking for the time <i>when the useful shall be the honorable</i>.</li>

<li>He <i>who enslaves another</i> cannot be free.</li>

<li>He <i>who attacks the right</i> assaults himself.</li>

<li>The force <i>that is in every atom and every star, in everything
that grows and thinks, that hopes and suffers</i>, is the only possible God.
</li>
<li>He <i>who adds to the sum of human misery</i> is a blasphemer.</li>

<li>The grandest ambition <i>that can enter the soul</i> is the desire
to know the truth.</li>
</ol>

<h3>ADVERB CLAUSES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_447">447.</b> The third kind of clause which we may use in a complex
sentence is the adverb clause.
</p>

<p><b>An adverb clause is a clause which takes the place of an adverb.</b>
It may modify a <i>verb</i>, an <i>adjective</i>, or an <i>adverb</i>.
We studied adverb clauses in lesson 21 and we found eight classes of adverb clauses,
expressing <i>time</i>, <i>place</i>, <i>cause</i> or <i>reason</i>, <i>manner</i>,
<i>comparison</i>, <i>condition</i>, <i>purpose</i> and <i>result</i>. For example:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Adverb clause of time:</b>
No man is truly free <i>until all are free</i>.</li>

<li><b>Adverb clause of place:</b>
We must live <i>where we can find work</i>.
</li>
<li><b>Adverb clause expressing cause or reason:</b>
We lost the strike <i>because the men were not class-conscious</i>.
</li>
<li><b>Adverb clause of manner:</b>
We must work <i>as if the result depended entirely upon us</i>.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_273" title="pg 273"></a>
<b>Adverb clause of comparison:</b>
The working class must become more class-conscious <i>than it is
today</i>.
</li>
<li><b>Adverb clause of condition:</b>
We will continue to be exploited <i>if we do not demand our rights</i>.
</li>
<li><b>Adverb clause expressing purpose:</b>
We must read the labor press <i>in order that we may know the truth
concerning conditions</i>.</li>

<li><b>Adverb clause expressing result:</b>
The battle raged so furiously <i>that thousands were slain</i>.</li>
</ol>


<h3>ANALYZING COMPLEX SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_448">448.</b> To analyze a complex sentence; that is, to break it up into
its different parts&mdash;treat the sentence first as a whole, then find the
simple subject and the simple predicate. If a noun clause is the
subject, treat it first as a noun. Treat adjective clauses as adjectives
modifying certain words and the adverb clauses as adverbs modifying certain words.
</p>

<p>In other words, analyze the sentence first as a simple sentence with
dependent clauses considered as modifying words; then analyze each
dependent clause as though it were a simple sentence. Make an outline
like the following and use it in your analysis of the sentence. Let us
take this sentence and analyze it:
</p>
<ul><li>
Conscious solidarity in the ranks would give the working class of
the world, now, in our day, the freedom which they seek.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Simple subject</b>, <i>solidarity</i>.</p>

<p><b>Simple predicate</b>, <i>would give</i>.</p>

<p>Modifiers of the subject:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjective, <i>conscious</i>.</li>

<li>Adjective phrase, <i>in the ranks</i>.</li>

<li>Adjective clause, (<i>none</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Complete subject</b>, <i>Conscious solidarity in the ranks</i>.</p>

<p>Modifiers of the predicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adverb, <i>now</i>.</li>

<li>Adverb phrase, <i>in our day</i>.</li>

<li>Adverb clause, (<i>none</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Direct object</b>, <i>freedom</i>.</p>

<p>Modifiers of direct object:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjective, <i>the</i>.</li>

<li>Adjective phrase, (<i>none</i>).</li>

<li>Adjective clause, <i>which they seek</i>,</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Indirect object</b>, <i>class</i>.</p>

<p>Modifiers of indirect object:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjectives, <i>the</i>, <i>working</i>.</li>

<li>Adjective phrase, <i>of the world</i>.</li>

<li>Adjective clause, (<i>none</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_274" title="pg 274"></a>
<b>Complete predicate</b>, <i>would give the working class of the world,
now, in our day, the freedom which they seek</i>.
</p>

<p>Analyze the dependent clause, <i>which they seek</i>, just as a principal
clause is analyzed. <i>They</i> is the simple subject, <i>seek</i> is the simple predicate,
<i>which</i> is the direct object. The complete predicate is <i>seek which</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_449">449.</b> Notice that the first two sentences given in the exercise
below are imperative sentences,&mdash;the subject, the pronoun <i>you</i>, being
omitted so that the entire sentence is the complete predicate. As for example:
<i>Take the place which belongs to you.</i> The omitted subject is the
pronoun <i>you</i>. <i>Take the place which belongs to you</i> is the complete
predicate, made up of the simple predicate <i>take</i>; its object, the noun
<i>place</i>; the adjective <i>the</i>, and the adjective clause, <i>which belongs to
you</i>, both of which modify the noun <i>place</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Using the outline given above, analyze the following complex sentences.</p>

<ol>
<li>Take the place which belongs to you.</li>
<li>Let us believe that brave deeds will never die.</li>
<li>The orator knows that the greatest ideas should be expressed in the simplest words.</li>
<li>Gratitude is the fairest flower that sheds its perfume in the human heart.</li>
<li>Children should be taught that it is their duty to think for themselves.</li>
<li>We will be slaves as long as we are ignorant.</li>
<li>We must teach our fellow men that honor comes from within.</li>
<li>Cause and effect cannot be severed for the effect already blooms in the cause.</li>
<li>Men measure their esteem of each other by what each has.</li>
<li>Our esteem should be measured by what each is.</li>
<li>What I must do is all that concerns me.</li>
<li>The great man is he who, in the midst of the crowd, keeps the independence of solitude.</li>
<li>The only right is what is after my constitution.</li>
<li>Whoso would be a man must be a non-conformist.</li>
<li>They who build on ideas build for eternity.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Exercise 7</h4>

<p>We have studied all the parts of speech, and now our work is to
combine these parts for the expression of thought. It will be good
practice and very helpful to us to mark these different parts of speech in our
reading. This helps us to grow familiar with their use. It also helps us
to add words to our vocabulary and to learn how to use them correctly.
In the following quotation, mark underneath each word, the name of
every part of speech. Use <i>n.</i> for noun, <i>v.</i> for verb,
<i>pro.</i> for pronoun, <i>adv.</i> for adverb, <i>adj.</i> for adjective, <i>p.</i> for
preposition and <i>c.</i> for conjunction. Write <i>v. p.</i> under the verb phrases. For example:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_275" title="pg 275"></a></p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>The</b></td><td><b>workers</b></td><td><b>of</b></td><td><b>the</b></td><td><b>world</b></td><td><b>do</b></td><td><b>not</b></td><td><b>have,</b></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>adj.</i></td>   <td><i>n.</i> </td>  <td><i>p.</i></td> <td><i>adj.</i></td>   <td><i>n.</i></td>  <td><i>v.p.</i></td><td><i>adv.</i></td>  <td><i>v.p.</i> </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>under</b></td><td><b>this</b></td><td><b>system,</b></td><td><b>very</b></td><td><b>many</b></td><td><b>opportunities</b></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>p.</i></td>  <td><i>adj.</i></td>    <td><i>n.</i></td><td><i>adv.</i></td><td><i>adj.</i></td><td><i>n.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>for</b></td><td><b>rest</b></td><td><b>and</b></td><td><b>pleasure</b></td><td><b>for</b></td>  <td><b>themselves.</b></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>p.</i></td><td><i>n.</i></td><td><i>c.</i></td><td><i>n.</i></td><td><i>p.</i></td><td><i>pro.</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Mark in this manner every part of speech in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class
struggles.
</p>

<p>Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster
and journeyman,&mdash;in a word, oppressor and oppressed,&mdash;stood in constant
opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight,
a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution
of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
</p>

<p>In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a
complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of
social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in
the middle ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen,
apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
</p>

<p>The modern bourgeois society, that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal
society, has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but
established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in
place of the old ones. <span class="author">&mdash;<i>Communist Manifesto.</i></span>
</p>

</blockquote>


<h4>Exercise 8</h4>

<p>In the following quotation, mark all of the clauses and determine
whether they are dependent or independent clauses. If they are dependent
clauses, determine whether they are noun, adjective or adverb
clauses. Mark all the sentences and tell whether they are simple or
complex.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me, and
causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of war,
corporations have been enthroned, and an era of corruption in high places will
follow. The money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its
reign by working upon the prejudices of the people, until all the wealth is
aggregated in a few hands, and the republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment
more anxiety for the safety of our country than ever before, even in the
midst of war. God grant that my forebodings may be groundless. Monarchy itself is
sometimes hinted at as a refuge from the power of the people. In my
present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit to raise a warning
voice against the approach of a returning despotism....
It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors
unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of it, induces him to
labor. Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit
of labor, and could not have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the
superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. I bid the
laboring people beware of surrendering the power which they possess, and which,
if surrendered, will surely be used to shut the door of advancement for
such as they, and fix new disabilities and burdens upon them until all of
liberty shall be lost.
</p>
<hr />

<p>In the early days of our race the Almighty said to the first of mankind,
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," and since then, if we except
the light and air of Heaven, no good thing has been or can be enjoyed by us
without first having cost labor. And inasmuch as most good things have been
<a class="pagenum" id="page_276" title="pg 276"></a>
produced by labor, it follows that all such things belong of right to those whose
labor has produced them. But it has so happened, in all ages of the world,
that some have labored and others have without labor enjoyed a large portion

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 26</h2>

<p>In our last lesson we had examples of words in which the <i>s</i> had the
soft sound, and also of words in which the <i>s</i> had the sound of <i>z</i>. In
some English words, it is difficult to determine which sound to use.
There are a number of words in English beginning with <i>dis</i>. In a few
of the words, the <i>s</i> has the sound of <i>z</i>, and in other words it has the
sound of <i>s</i>. There are only a few words which are pronounced with
the <i>diz</i> sound. <i>Discern</i>, <i>dismal</i> and <i>dissolve</i>
are always pronounced with
the <i>diz</i> sound. <i>Disease</i> and <i>disaster</i> are pronounced both ways. Some
dictionaries give the <i>diz</i> sound and some give the <i>dis</i> sound.
</p>

<p>The spelling lesson for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday contains
a number of words beginning with <i>dis</i>. Be sure of the pronunciation.
Run through the words in the dictionary beginning with the <i>dis</i> sound
and mark those in which the <i>dis</i> has the sound of <i>diz</i>.
</p>

<p>We have also a number of words in the English language which end
in <i>ise</i> or <i>ize</i>, and we are often confused to know which ending to use.
There is a rule, which has very few exceptions, which covers the use of
<i>ise</i> and <i>ize</i>. Words should be spelled with the <i>ize</i>
ending when the <i>ize</i>
can be cut off, and the word that is left can be used alone. For
example; <i>author</i>, <i>authorize</i>. In this word you can cut off the
<i>ize</i> and the word
<i>author</i> can be used alone. But in the word <i>exercise</i>, if you
cut off the <i>ise</i>, the remaining portion cannot be used alone.
</p>

<p><i>Recognize</i> and <i>criticise</i> are exceptions to this rule. When
used as a suffix added to a noun or adjective to form a verb, <i>ize</i> is the
proper ending; as <i>theory</i>, <i>theorize</i>, <i>civil</i>,
<i>civilize</i>, etc. <span class="corr" title="Find">Final</span> <i>e</i> or <i>y</i> is
dropped before <i>ize</i>, as in the words <i>memorize</i>, <i>sterilize</i>,
etc.
</p>

<p>The spelling lesson for Thursday, Friday and Saturday contains a
number of common words ending with <i>ize</i> or <i>ise</i>. Study

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 27</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>Ingersoll said: "Words are the garments of thought and the robes
of ideas." This is a beautiful and poetic way of expressing the relationship
between words and thoughts. Words are really the body which
we give to our thoughts. Until they are clothed in words, our thoughts
are only ghosts of ideas. Other people cannot see or come into contact
with them, and they can have but little influence upon the world.
</p>

<p>Without thought, no language is possible. It is equally true that
without language, no growth of thought is possible. It is futile to try
to determine which is first, language or thought. The two are entirely
necessary to each other and make possible social and individual
development.
</p>

<p>Every time that you add a word to your vocabulary, you have
added to your mental equipment. You have also added greatly to
your power of enjoyment. Through these words you will come into a
new relationship to your fellow men. Each new word enlarges the circle
of your acquaintance. A knowledge of language brings us into a circle
of wonderful friends. When we have learned to read we need never
more be lonely. Some one has written in a book somewhere just the
thing we are hungry for at this moment.
</p>

<p>In the pages of a book we can meet and talk with the great souls
who have written in these pages their life's experience. No matter
what mood you are in, you can find a book to suit that mood. No
matter what your need, there is a book which meets that need. Form
the habit of reading and you will find it a wonderful source of pleasure
and of profit.
</p>

<p>Nor do we need to be barred because of our lack of educational
advantages in our youth. Buckle, the author of the greatest history that
has ever been written, left school at the age of fourteen, and it is said
that at that age, except a smattering of mathematics, he knew only how
to read; but when he died at the age of forty, this man, who did not
know his letters when he was eight years old, could read and write seven
languages and was familiar with ten or twelve more. He had written
a wonderful book and had become a teacher of teachers. Engraven
upon his marble altar tomb is the following couplet:
</p>

<div class="poem left">
<p>"The written word remains long after the writer.</p>
<p>The writer is resting under the earth, but his words endure."</p>
</div>

<p>Good books are so cheap nowadays that they are within the reach
of every one of us. Let us not be content to live in the narrow world
of work and worry. Let us forget the struggle occasionally in the
reading of books, and let us prepare ourselves, by reading and studying, for
the battle for the emancipation of the workers of the world.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_279" title="pg 279"></a>KINDS OF SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_450">450.</b> <b>A simple sentence is a sentence which makes a single
assertion, question or command.</b>
</p>
<p>The simple sentence contains only words and phrases.</p>

<p><b id="sec_451">451.</b> <b>A complex sentence is one which contains a principal
statement and one or more modifying statements.</b></p>

<p>The statements made in addition to the principal statement are
made in dependent clauses. The complex sentence has only one main
clause and one or more dependent clauses.</p>

<p><b id="sec_452">452.</b> <b>A compound sentence is one which contains two or more
independent clauses.</b></p>

<p>These compound sentences may contain any number of dependent
clauses but they must always have at least two independent or principal
clauses. These principal clauses are always connected by co-ordinate
conjunctions, for the principal clauses in a compound sentence are
always of equal rank or order.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Review the lesson on co-ordinate conjunctions and notice which
conjunctions are used to unite principal clauses into single sentences.
Use these co-ordinate conjunctions to unite the following pairs of
simple sentences into compound sentences. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The sun rises <i>and</i> the day dawns.</li>
<li>The men work <i>but</i> the boys play.</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tr><td>The sun rises.</td><td>The day dawns.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He studies diligently.</td><td>He learns rapidly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>He came early.</td><td>He could not stay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The weather is cold.</td><td>The plants are not growing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The men work.</td><td>The boys play.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The day is cold.</td><td>The wind is blowing.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Take the above sentences and use subordinate instead of co-ordinate
conjunctions, and make complex sentences instead of compound out of
each pair of simple sentences. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>When</i> the sun rises, the day dawns.</li>
<li>The men work <i>while</i> the boys play.</li>
</ul>


<h3>KINDS OF COMPOUND SENTENCES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_453">453.</b> <b>Compound sentences may be made up of two simple
sentences.</b></p>

<p>Rewrite the following compound sentences, making of each sentence
two simple sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>The birds are singing and spring is here.</li>
<li>He believes in war but his brother is against it.</li>
<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_280" title="pg 280"></a>
We must arouse ourselves or we shall be involved.</li>
<li>He will not study nor will he allow any one else to study.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_454">454.</b> <b>A compound sentence may be made up of a simple sentence
and a complex sentence, joined by a co-ordinate conjunction.</b>
For example:</p>

<ul><li>
John goes to school, but Mary stays at home in order that she may
help her mother.
</li></ul>

<p>This compound sentence is made up of the simple sentence, <i>John
goes to school</i>, and the complex sentence, <i>Mary stays at home in
orderthat she may help her mother</i>.
</p>
<p><b id="sec_455">455.</b> <b>Both parts of the compound sentence may be complex;
that is, both principal clauses in a compound sentence may contain
dependent clauses.</b> For example:</p>


<ul><li>John goes to school where his brother goes, but Mary stays at home
in order that she may help her mother.</li></ul>

<p>This compound sentence is made up of two complex sentences.
The sentence, <i>John goes to school where his brother goes</i>, is
complex because it contains the dependent clause, <i>where his brother goes</i>; the
sentence, <i>Mary stays at home in order that she may help her mother</i>, is
complex because it contains the dependent clause, <i>in order that she
may help her mother</i>.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Read carefully the following sentences, determine which are simple
sentences, which are complex and which are compound.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When the state is corrupt, then the laws are most multiplied.</li>
<li>To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate revolution.</li>
<li>Freedom degenerates unless it has to struggle in its own defense.</li>
<li>The destroyers have always been honored.</li>
<li>Liberty of thought is a mockery if liberty of speech is denied.</li>
<li>Where slavery is, there liberty cannot be; and where liberty is, there slavery cannot be.</li>
<li>All our greatness was born of liberty and we cannot strangle
the mother without destroying her children.</li>
<li>In the twentieth century, war will be dead, but man will live.</li>
<li>The abuse of free speech dies in a day, but the denial entombs
the hope of the race.</li>
</ol>


<h3>SENTENCE ANALYSIS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_456">456.</b> There is no more important part of the study of English than
the analysis of sentences. The very best result that can come to one
from the study of grammar is the logical habit of mind. The effort to
analyze a difficult passage gives us a fuller appreciation of its
meaning. This cultivates in us accuracy, both of thought and of expression. So,
spend as much time as you can on the analysis of sentences.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_281" title="pg 281"></a>
The subject and the predicate are the very body of the sentence,
upon which all the rest of the sentence is hung. The other parts of the
sentence are but the drapery and the garments which clothe the body of
the sentence. Hence, the most important thing in sentence analysis
is to be able to discover the <i>subject</i> and <i>predicate</i>.
</p>

<p>In the expression of a thought, there are always two important
essentials, that about which something is said,&mdash;which constitutes the
subject,&mdash;and that which is said about the subject, which constitutes
the predicate.
</p>

<p>There may be a number of modifying words, phrases or subordinate
clauses, but there is always a main clause which contains a simple
subject and a simple predicate. Find these first, and you can then fit
the modifying words and phrases and clauses into their proper places.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_457">457.</b> Let us take for study and analysis the following paragraph
from Jack London:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man's efficiency for food-getting and shelter-getting has not diminished
since the day of the cave-man. It has increased a thousand-fold.
Wonderful artifices and marvelous inventions have been made. Why then do millions
of modern men live more miserably than the cave-man lived?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us take the first sentence out of this paragraph and analyze it.
<i>Man's efficiency for food-getting and shelter-getting has not
diminished since the day of the cave-man.</i> What is the main word in this
sentence&mdash;the
word about which the entire statement is made? Clearly it is the
word <i>efficiency</i>. <i>Efficiency</i> is the noun which is the
subject of the sentence.
</p>

<p>Then you might ask <i>what sort of</i> efficiency and <i>whose</i>
efficiency? What sort of efficiency is explained by the adjective phrase, <i>for
food-getting and shelter-getting</i>. Whose efficiency is explained by the possessive
noun, <i>man's</i>. Therefore, the complete subject is, <i>Man's
efficiency for food-getting and shelter-getting</i>.
</p>

<p>Now we are ready to consider the predicate. What has efficiency
done? It <i>has not diminished</i>. <i>Has diminished</i> is the verb
phrase, which is the simple predicate of this sentence. It is modified by the
adverb <i>not</i>, so we have <i>Man's efficiency has not
diminished</i>. Then we
might ask, <i>when</i> has it not diminished? And this is answered by
the phrase, <i>since the day of the cave-man</i>. So we have our complete
predicate, <i>Has not diminished since the day of the cave-man</i>.
</p>

<p>In this way we can analyze or break up into its different parts, every
sentence. First find the subject, then ask what that subject does, and
the answer will be the predicate or verb. Do not confuse the verb with
the words which state <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> the action is performed,
and do not confuse the verb with the <i>object</i> of the action. The verb simply
asserts the action. The other words will add the additional information as to
how or why or when or upon whom the action was performed.
</p>

<p>Let us finish the analysis of the sentences in the paragraph quoted
from Jack London. In the second sentence, <i>It has increased a
thousand-fold</i>, the personal pronoun <i>it</i>, which refers to the noun
<i>efficiency</i>, is the subject of the sentence; and when you ask what <i>it</i> has
<i>done</i>, you find that the question is answered by the verb, <i>has increased</i>.
Therefore,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_282" title="pg 282"></a>
<i>has increased</i> is the verb in the sentence. The noun,
<i>thousand-fold</i> is used as an adverb telling how much it has increased. It is an
adverb-noun, which you will find explained in Section 291.
</p>

<p>In the next sentence, <i>Wonderful artifices and marvelous inventions
have been made</i>, we find two <i>nouns</i> about which a statement is
made.<i>Artifices</i> have been made and <i>inventions</i> have been made; so
<i>artifices</i> and <i>inventions</i> are both the <i>subjects</i> of the sentence.
Therefore, we have a compound subject with a single verb, <i>have been made</i>.
<i>Artifices</i> is modified by the adjective <i>wonderful</i>, and <i>inventions</i> is
modified by the adjective <i>marvelous</i>, so we have <i>wonderful artifices and
marvelous inventions</i>, as the complete subject, and <i>have been made</i>, as the complete
predicate.
</p>

<p>In the last sentence, <i>Why then do millions of modern men live more
miserably than the cave-man lived?</i>, we find a sentence which is a
trifle more difficult of analysis. It is written in the interrogative form. If
you find it difficult to determine the subject and the verb or verb
phrase in an interrogative sentence, rewrite the sentence in the assertive
form, and you will find it easier to analyze.
</p>

<p>When we rewrite this sentence we have, <i>Millions of modern men do
live more miserably than the cave-man lived.</i> Now it is evident that
the noun <i>millions</i> is the subject of the sentence. We see quickly
that <i>men</i> cannot be the subject because it is the object of the
preposition <i>of</i>, in the phrase, <i>of modern men</i>. So we decide that the noun
<i>millions</i> is the simple subject.
</p>

<p>When we ask the question what millions <i>do</i>, our question is
answered by the verb phrase, <i>do live</i>. So <i>do live</i> is the simple
predicate, and the skeleton of our sentence, the simple subject and the simple
predicate, is <i>millions do live</i>. The subject <i>millions</i> is modified by
the adjective phrase <i>of modern men</i>.
</p>

<p>Then we ask, <i>how</i> do men live? And we find our question answered
by <i>they live miserably</i>. But we are told <i>how</i> miserably they
live by the adverb <i>more</i> and the adverb clause, <i>than the cave-man
lived</i>, both modifying the adverb <i>miserably</i>. So we have our complete
predicate, <i>do live more miserably than the cave-man lived</i>.
</p>

<p>This interrogative sentence is introduced by the interrogative adverb
<i>why</i>.
</p>

<p>Do not drop this subject until you are able to determine readily
the <i>subject</i> and <i>predicate</i> in every sentence and properly
place all modifying words. There is nothing that will so increase your power of
understanding what you read, and your ability to write clearly, as this
facility in analyzing sentences.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>The following is Elbert Hubbard's description of the child-laborers
of the Southern cotton-mills. Read it carefully. Notice that the
sentences are all short sentences, and the cumulative effect of these
short sentences is a picture of the condition of these child-workers
which one can never forget. The subjects and predicates are in italics. When
you have finished your study of this question, rewrite it from memory
and then compare your version with the original version.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_283" title="pg 283"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I thought</i> that <i>I would lift</i> one of the little toilers.
<i>I wanted</i> to ascertain
his weight. Straightway through his thirty-five pounds of skin and bone
there <i>ran</i> a <i>tremor</i> of fear. <i>He struggled</i> forward to tie a
broken thread. <i>I attracted</i>
his attention by a touch. <i>I offered</i> him a silver dime. <i>He
looked</i> at me dumbly from a face <i>that might have belonged</i> to a man of sixty.
<i>It was</i> so furrowed, tightly drawn and full of pain. <i>He did</i> not <i>reach</i>
for the money. <i>He did</i> not <i>know</i> what <i>it was</i>. There <i>were
dozens</i> of such children in this
particular mill. A <i>physician who was</i> with me <i>said</i> that
<i>they would</i> probably
all <i>be</i> dead in two years. Their <i>places would be</i> easily
<i>filled</i>, however, for
there <i>were</i> plenty <i>more</i>. <i>Pneumonia carries</i> off most
of them. Their <i>systems
are</i> ripe for disease and when <i>it comes</i> there <i>is</i> no
<i>rebound</i>. <i>Medicine</i> simply
<i>does</i> not <i>act</i>. <i>Nature is whipped, beaten,
discouraged.</i> <i>The child sinks</i> into a stupor and <i>dies</i>.</p>
</blockquote>


<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>In the following sentences, mark the simple sentences, the complex
sentences and the compound sentences, and analyze these sentences
according to the rules given for analyzing simple sentences, complex
sentences and compound sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Force is no remedy.</li>

<li>Law grinds the poor, and the rich men rule the law.</li>

<li>Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues.</li>

<li>Freedom is a new religion, a religion of our time.</li>

<li>Desire nothing for yourself which you do not desire for others.</li>

<li>An ambassador is a man who goes abroad to lie for the good
of his country.</li>

<li>A journalist is a man who stays at home to pursue the same
vocation.</li>

<li>Without free speech no search for truth is possible.</li>

<li>Liberty for the few is not liberty.</li>

<li>Liberty for me and slavery for you mean slavery for both.</li>

<li>No revolution ever rises above the intellectual level of those
who make it.</li>

<li>Men submit everywhere to oppression when they have only to
lift their heads to throw off the yoke.
</li>
<li>Many politicians of our time are in the habit of saying that no
people ought to be free till they are fit to use freedom. The maxim is
worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the
water till he had learned to swim. If men are to wait for liberty till they
become wise and good in slavery they may indeed wait forever.</li>

<p>So long as you have only words and phrases you have simple sentences.
When you add a dependent clause you have a complex sentence.
When you unite two independent clauses in one sentence, then you have
a compound sentence, and the connecting word will always be a co-ordinate

only a few co-ordinate conjunctions.
</p>

<p>Go back to the lesson on co-ordinate conjunctions and find out what
these are, and whenever you find two clauses connected by these co-ordinate
conjunctions you know that you have a compound sentence.
Remember that each clause must contain a subject and predicate of its
own. When you have two words connected by these co-ordinate conjunctions
you do not have a clause. Each clause must contain a subject
and a predicate of its own.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_463">463.</b> Here is an example of a sentence built up from a simple subject
and a simple predicate:
</p>

<h3>SIMPLE SUBJECT ENLARGED</h3>

<p><b>Simple Subject and Predicate</b>&mdash;<i>Soldiers obey.</i></p>

<p><i>Adjectives</i> added&mdash;<i>The enlisted</i> soldiers obey.</p>

<p><i>Phrase</i> added&mdash;The enlisted soldiers <i>in the trenches</i> obey.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> added&mdash;The enlisted soldiers in the trenches, <i>who are
doomed to die</i>, obey.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE PREDICATE ENLARGED</h3>

<p><b>Simple Subject and Predicate</b>&mdash;<i>Soldiers obey.</i></p>

<p><i>Object</i> added&mdash;Soldiers obey <i>orders</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adverb</i> added&mdash;Soldiers obey orders <i>quickly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phrase</i> added&mdash;Soldiers obey orders quickly and <i>without question</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> added&mdash;Soldiers obey orders quickly and without question
<i>because they are taught to do so</i>.</p>

<p>Combining our enlarged subject and predicate we have the sentence:</p>

<ul><li>
The enlisted soldiers in the trenches, who are doomed to die, obey
orders quickly and without question because they are taught to do so.
</li></ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_286" title="pg 286"></a>
This is a complex sentence because it contains dependent clauses.
We might add another independent clause and make of this a compound
sentence. For example:
</p>
<ul><li>
The enlisted soldiers in the trenches, who are doomed to die, obey
orders quickly and without question because they are taught to do so,
and <i>this is patriotism</i>.

SPELLING</h2>
<h2>LESSON 27</h2>

<p>We have studied concerning the formation of derivatives by the
addition of suffixes. Derivatives are also formed by the addition of
prefixes. You remember that a prefix is a syllable which is placed before
a simple word to form the derivative. Among the most common
of these prefixes are <i>in</i>, <i>un</i> and <i>mis</i>. The prefix
<i>in</i> used with an adjective
or adverb means <i>not</i>; for example, <i>insane</i> means <i>not</i>
sane; <i>incorrect</i> means <i>not</i> correct, etc.
</p>

<p>The prefix <i>in</i> used with a noun means <i>lack of</i>; for example,
<i>inexperience</i> means <i>lack of</i> experience; <i>inability</i> means <i>lack of</i>
ability, etc.
</p>

<p>In words beginning with <i>m</i> or <i>p</i>, <i>in</i>, meaning <i>not</i> or <i>lack of</i>, is
changed to <i>im</i>. This is done for the sake of euphony. The <i>n</i> does not
unite readily with the sound of <i>m</i> or <i>p</i>. So we do not say <i>inmodest</i> and
<i>inpartial</i>, but <i>immodest</i> and <i>impartial</i>.
</p>

<p>The prefix <i>un</i>, used with participles, means <i>not</i>; for example, <i>unprepared</i>
means <i>not</i> prepared; <i>unguarded</i> means <i>not</i> guarded, etc.
</p>

<p>The prefix <i>un</i> used with verbs, means to take off or to reverse; for
example, <i>uncover</i> means to take off the cover; <i>untwist</i> means to reverse
the process of the twisting.
</p>

<p>The prefix <span class="corr" title="in"><i>un</i></span> used with adjectives means <i>not</i>; for example, <i>uncertain</i>
means <i>not</i> certain; <i>uncommon</i> means <i>not</i> common.
</p>

<p>The prefix <i>mis</i> used with nouns or verbs, means <i>wrong</i>. For example,
<i>mistreatment</i> means <i>wrong</i> treatment; <i>to misspell</i>
means to spell <i>wrong</i>.
</p>

<p>Add the prefix <i>in</i> to the nouns given in Monday's list; add the
prefix <i>in</i> to the adjectives given in Tuesday's list; add the prefix <i>im</i> to
the adjectives and nouns in Wednesday's lesson; add the prefix <i>un</i> to
the participles and adjectives in Thursday's lesson; add the prefix <i>un</i>
to the verbs in Friday's lesson, and add the prefix <i>mis</i> to the

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 28</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>We are beginning with this lesson the study of the use of capitals
and of punctuation. The use of capitals as well as punctuation has
nothing to do with our spoken words, but both are very important in
our written language.
</p>

<p>There is nothing that will mark us as uneducated more quickly than
bad spelling, faulty punctuation and the incorrect use of capitals.
</p>

<p>The rules for the use of capitals may seem somewhat arbitrary.
After an understanding of them, however, you will discover that they
are not arbitrary, but are based upon a single principle. The word
which is of the most importance, or which should receive the most
emphasis is the word which is capitalized, as for example, the principal
words in a title, the first words in a sentence, proper names, etc.
</p>

<p>Study these rules carefully, note the use of the capitals in your
reading and watch your written language carefully for a time. Soon
the proper use of capitals will seem easy and most natural. In the
meantime do not fail to keep up your study of words. Add at least
one word to your vocabulary every day.
</p>

<p>Did you ever consider how we think in pictures? Nearly every
word that we use calls up a certain image or picture in our minds. The
content of words has grown and developed as our ability to think has
developed.
</p>

<p>Take, for example, words like head or hand. Head originally
referred to a portion of the body of a living thing; then it was used to
refer to some part of an inanimate object which might resemble or call
up a picture of an animal's head, for example, the head of a pin. Again,
it was used to refer to some part of an inanimate thing which was
associated with the head of a human being, as the head of the bed. Then,
by the power of association, since the head was considered the most
conspicuous and important part of the body, that which was most
conspicuous and important was called the head, as the head of the
army, the head of the nation.
</p>

<p>Then, since the head was the seat of the brain and of the mental
faculties, the head was often used instead of the brain or mental
faculties. We speak of a clear head or a cool head. Thus we have a number
of idiomatic expressions. We may speak of the head of the river;
or the subject matter was divided under four heads; or again, the matter
came to a head; he is head and ears in debt; we cannot make head
against the opposition, etc.
</p>

<p>This transfer of our ideas from the physical to the mental and
spiritual marks vividly the growth of the language and the development
of thought. Trace the words like hands, arm, foot, eye, tongue, in
their use, first as physical then as mental or spiritual.
</p>

<p>This will be the most interesting pastime and will enlarge the content
of the words which you use.
</p>

<h3>CAPITAL LETTERS<a class="pagenum" id="page_289" title="pg 289"></a></h3>

<p><b id="sec_464">464.</b> In our written speech we often display our lack of education
by our use of capital letters and punctuation. We may understand
the use of words and be able to speak fairly well, but if we do not
understand the proper use of capitals and of punctuation marks, our
written language readily betrays our ignorance.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_465">465.</b> There are a number of rules for the use of capitals which we
must observe. Some of the writers in our magazines defy these rules
of capitalization, in an effort to seem different from other people, perhaps.
These rules for the use of capital letters, like all other rules, are
not arbitrary rules laid down by any body of men, but are simply a
statement of accepted usage among people. We should not feel that
we should say this or that or we are violating a rule of grammar. We
should feel rather that the majority of the people who speak and write
good English do thus, and so, for this reason, I shall do it also.
</p>

<p>This is simply obeying the standard of majority rule. If there is
any good and sufficient reason why we feel this should not be a rule,
we may be justified in breaking it and making a new rule. Many people
feel that our spelling should be simplified and so they insist upon spelling
certain words in a more simple way. They feel that they have good
and sufficient reason for insisting upon this change and gradually if
these reasons appeal to the majority as being good and sufficient reasons,
then this simplified mode of spelling will become the accepted usage.
</p>

<p>But there seems no good reason why any writer should scatter
capital letters with a lavish hand throughout his writing. One feels as
though a writer in so doing is expressing his desire to be different, in a
very superficial manner. Let us be unique and individual in our thought.
If this forces us to a different mode of living or of expression from the
rest of the world, then we are justified in being different from the rest.
We have thought and reason behind our action. This is far different
from the attitude of one who poses as a radical and whose only protest
is in the superficial external things. So let us learn and observe these
rules for the use of capital letters.
</p>

<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF CAPITAL LETTERS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_466">466.</b> <b>Use a capital for the first word of every sentence.</b></p>

<p>When you begin a new sentence always begin that sentence with a
capital letter. Each sentence is a statement of a complete thought and
is independent of every other sentence. The use of the capital letter
indicates this independence and calls attention to the fact that you
are beginning a new thought.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_467">467.</b> <b>Begin every line of poetry with a capital letter.</b>
Sometimes in poetry, the line is too long to be printed on a single line and must
be carried over into another line; in this case, the first word of the
second line does <i>not</i> begin with a capital letter.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_468">468.</b> <b>Use a capital for every proper noun.</b> This includes
names of persons, countries, states, towns, cities, streets and geographical
names, as the names of seas, lakes, mountains, rivers, etc.
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_290" title="pg 290"></a>
<b id="sec_469">469.</b> <b>The words North, South, East and West are capitalized
when they are used to refer to geographical divisions.</b>  When these
words simply refer to the points of the compass, they should not begin
with a capital.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_470">470.</b> <b>The pronoun</b> <i>I</i> <b>and the interjection</b> <i>O</i> <b>should always be
capitals.</b>  Never write the pronoun <i>I</i> with a small <i>i</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_471">471.</b> <b>Every proper adjective should begin with a capital letter.</b>
Proper adjectives are adjectives derived from proper nouns. For example:
the <i>Marxian</i> philosophy, the <i>Darwinian</i> theory,
<i>Indian</i> money, <i>Japanese</i> labor, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_472">472.</b> <b>Always begin the names of the months and the days of
the week with capital letters.</b>  For example: <i>January</i>,
<i>February</i>, <i>August</i>,
<i>Monday</i>, <i>Tuesday</i>, <i>Friday</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_473">473.</b> <b>Use a capital letter for every name or title of the
Deity.</b> For example: <i>God</i>, <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>Christ</i>, <i>Jesus</i>,
etc. It is also customary to capitalize all personal pronouns referring to God or Christ.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_474">474.</b> <b>Begin with a capital letter names of all religious sects
and political parties, also all adjectives derived from them.</b> As for
example: <i>Christian Church</i>, <i>Methodism</i>, <i>Republican Party</i>,
<i>Mohammedan</i>, <i>Socialist</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_475">475.</b> <b>Begin the names of all things spoken of as persons with
a capital.</b> In poetry or poetic prose we often speak of <i>war</i>, <i>fame</i>, <i>death</i>,
<i>hope</i>, <i>fancy</i>, <i>liberty</i>, etc., as persons. Whenever these words are used
in this way they should begin with a capital letter.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_476">476.</b> <b>Use capital letters to begin important words in the title
of a book or the subject of a composition.</b> In titles the nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs and adverbs should begin with a capital, while
the prepositions and conjunctions should begin with small letters. The
articles, <i>the</i>, <i>a</i> and <i>an</i> are not capitalized unless
they are the initial word in the title.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_477">477.</b> <b>Use a capital to begin every direct quotation.</b>  The first
word of an indirect quotation should begin with a small letter. A direct
quotation is one which uses the exact words of the speaker. For example:
<i>He said</i>, "<i>I will come.</i>" This is a direct quotation, but
<i>He said that he would come</i>, is an indirect quotation.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_478">478.</b> <b>Use a capital to begin an important statement or to ask a
question.</b> For example: <i>Resolved; That the United States should
democratize war. The question is, Shall the people determine the question
of war?</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_479">479.</b> <b>Use capitals for the chief items of any enumeration of
particulars.</b> For example;
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_291" title="pg 291"></a></p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="2" align="left">The bill is as follows:</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-indent: 2em; ">For Composition</td><td>$20.00</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-indent: 2em; ">For Press Work</td><td align="right">10.00</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-indent: 2em; ">Paper</td><td align="right">25.00</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b id="sec_480">480.</b> <b>Begin the words indicating titles of offices and honor
with a capital.</b> For example, <i>President Wilson</i>, <i>Doctor
Smith</i>, <i>Professor Locke</i>. When you use a title of this kind as a general term, that
is, not indicating any particular person, do not use a capital. As for
example: <i>The society has had several presidents.</i> But if you use
the title to take the place of the person's name, for example: <i>The President
read the message to Congress</i>, always use a capital.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_481">481.</b> <b>Use capitals for the titles at the beginning of a letter
or in written composition and in direct address.</b> For example: <i>My
dear Father</i>, <i>My dear Mother</i>, <i>My dear Comrade</i>, <i>Dear Aunt
Emma</i>, <i>Dear Friend</i>, <i>Dear Fellow Workers</i>, etc. Also in conversation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you coming with me, Mother?</li>
<li>What did the Doctor say, Comrade Smith?</li>
</ul>

<p>When these words are not used in direct address, however, they
should not be capitalized. For example, at the close of a letter you
would write:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your sincere friend.</li>
<li>Your loving brother.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or in conversation:</p>

<ul>
<li>I asked my mother to go with me.</li>
<li>My brother wrote me concerning the matter.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_482">482.</b> <b>Begin the names of important buildings and localities with a capital.</b> For example:
</p>
<ul><li>
Public Library, High School, The East Side, The Union Square,
Central Market, etc.
</li></ul>

<p>These words used in a general sense, however, should not begin
with a capital letter. For example:
</p>
<ul><li>Our public libraries, our high schools, jails, prisons, post offices, etc.</li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_483">483.</b> <b>The words state and territory, when they refer to
particular divisions of the country, should be capitalized.</b> For example:
</p>

<ul><li>The State of New York, The Territory of Alaska, The French Government, etc.</li></ul>

<p><i>State</i> and <i>government</i> are also capitalized when they are
used in place of proper names. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The State is based on exploitation.</li>
<li>The Government has issued an edict of war.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use a capital in such expressions as:</p>

<ul><li>Church and state, state affairs; they occupy a large territory, etc.</li></ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_292" title="pg 292"></a>
<b id="sec_484">484.</b> <b>In directing letters or other matter for the mail, capitalize
all words except prepositions, conjunctions or articles.</b> These should
be capitalized only when they begin a line.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

ABBREVIATIONS AND CONTRACTIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_485">485.</b> There are a number of words which we abbreviate or contract,
in our every-day use. A contraction is a shortened form of the
word used to save time or space and is made by omitting a letter or
letters. The apostrophe is used to indicate the omission in a contracted
word. As, for example:
</p>

<ul><li>B'ld'g, B'l'v'd, M'f'g.</li></ul>


<p>When the word is contracted in this way and the apostrophe is
used, these contractions are not followed by the period but are used
just as the completely written word would be used. There is no accepted
list of these contractions. We devise them according to our need at the
moment.
</p>

<p>An abbreviation, however, is an authorized contraction of the word.
It is the shortening of a term which is habitually used to save time and
space. The apostrophe is not used and the abbreviation should be
followed by a period. As for example:
</p>

<ul><li>Bldg.  Blvd.  Mfg.</li></ul>

<p>These abbreviations and contractions are very helpful to us in
saving time and space but should not be used too frequently. Too many
contractions or abbreviations make writing ridiculous. Take time to
write out the majority of words. Only use abbreviations or contractions
for certain accepted words. Avoid an excessive use of abbreviations.
</p>

<h3>COMMONLY USED ABBREVIATIONS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_486">486.</b> We quite often abbreviate the names of the months,
especially those which have long names. Short names like <i>March</i>,
<i>April</i>, <i>May</i>,
<i>June</i> and <i>July</i>, should never be abbreviated. For the other
months we use in correspondence the abbreviations, <i>Jan.</i>, <i>Feb.</i>,
<i>Aug.</i>, <i>Sept.</i>, <i>Oct.</i>,
<i>Nov.</i>, <i>Dec.</i> Days of the week are also sometimes abbreviated
as follows: <i>Sun.</i>, <i>Mon.</i>, <i>Tues.</i>, <i>Wed.</i>, <i>Thur.</i>,
<i>Fri.</i>, <i>Sat.</i> Do not use these abbreviations
too often. Spell out the names of the months and of the days of
the week except in lists of dates or something that calls for
abbreviations to save time or space.
</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Messrs.</i>, <i>Jr.</i>, <i>Sr.</i>, are
never spelled out, but are always
written in the abbreviated form. You will often find <i>Doctor</i> and
<i>Professor</i> abbreviated to <i>Dr.</i>, <i>Prof.</i> This is permissible but it is
always good form to write them out in full.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_487">487.</b> We have abbreviated forms for a number of names; as for
example: <i>Geo.</i>, <i>Chas.</i>, <i>Thos.</i>, <i>Wm.</i>, etc. But
it is always much better
to write these names out in full: <i>George</i>, <i>Charles</i>,
<i>Thomas</i>, <i>William</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>Remember that nicknames are not abbreviations and do not require
a period after them. <i>Jim</i>, <i>Charley</i>, <i>Tom</i>, and
<i>Bill</i> are not abbreviations but nicknames.
</p>

<p>In correspondence or in any circumstance that demands the saving
of time or space, we abbreviate the names of states and territories, as
follows:
</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_295" title="pg 295"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Alabama, Ala.</li>
<li>Arizona, Ariz.</li>
<li>Arkansas, Ark.</li>
<li>California, Cal.</li>
<li>Colorado, Colo.</li>
<li>Connecticut, Conn.</li>
<li>Delaware, Del.</li>
<li>District of Columbia, D. C.</li>
<li>Florida, Fla.</li>
<li>Georgia, Ga.</li>
<li>Idaho, Ida.</li>
<li>Illinois, Ill.</li>
<li>Indiana, Ind.</li>
<li>Iowa, Ia.</li>
<li>Kansas, Kan.</li>
<li>Kentucky, Ky.</li>
<li>Louisiana, La.</li>
<li>Maine, Me.</li>
<li>Maryland, Md.</li>
<li>Massachusetts, Mass.</li>
<li>Michigan, Mich.</li>
<li>Minnesota, Minn.</li>
<li>Mississippi, Miss.</li>
<li>Missouri, Mo.</li>
<li>Montana, Mont.</li>
<li>Nebraska, Neb.</li>
<li>Nevada, Nev.</li>
<li>New Hampshire, N. H.</li>
<li>New Jersey, N. J.</li>
<li>New Mexico, N. M.</li>
<li>New York, N. Y.</li>
<li>North Carolina, N. C.</li>
<li>North Dakota, N. D.</li>
<li>Ohio, O.</li>
<li>Oklahoma, Okla.</li>
<li>Oregon, Ore.</li>
<li>Pennsylvania, Pa. or Penna.</li>
<li>Rhode Island, R. I.</li>

<li>Virginia, Va.</li>
<li>Washington, Wash.</li>
<li>West Virginia, W. Va.</li>
<li>Wisconsin, Wis.</li>
<li>Wyoming, Wyo.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_488">488.</b> Use <i>a. m.</i> and <i>p. m.</i> after dates in lists of
dates or schedules of trains or for any similar purpose, but in the text of a letter or
manuscript it is better to write them out in full. As for example, do not say:
</p>

<ul><li>I will arrive tomorrow a. m., or, You may call about eight p. m.</li></ul>

<p>Say rather:</p>


<ul><li>I will arrive tomorrow morning. You may call at eight o'clock this evening.</li></ul>

<p>The letters <i>a. m.</i> are the abbreviation for ante meridiem, Latin
for before noon; and <i>p. m.</i> for post meridiem, meaning afternoon.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_489">489.</b> Two consecutive years may be written 1914-15, but use 1915
rather than '15. In the heading of letters it is better to write the
date out in full, as, <i>May 28, 1915</i>, instead of 5-28-15.
</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 28</h2>

<p>There is no way to learn to spell except by constant application.
Watch in your reading the spelling of all words. Whenever you wish to
add a certain word to your vocabulary, master immediately the spelling
as well as the meaning of that word. Keep your dictionary handy;
use it constantly in the study of your lessons. Do not guess at the spelling
of the word. You are not likely to forget quickly the spelling of
any word which you have taken the trouble to look up.
</p>

<p>Read your examinations over carefully before sending them in,
watching closely for any error in spelling and in punctuation. When your
papers are graded and returned you, make a list of all the words
which are misspelled and master then and there the spelling of these
words. Do not be guilty of the same error twice. Remember that
correct spelling is a mark of intelligence and scholarship and that nothing
will so detract from the influence of your written work as incorrect spelling.
</p>

<p>While there is always a certain word which more aptly expresses
our meaning than any other, we can usually find two or more words
which express practically the same meaning.
</p>

<p><b>Words which have nearly the same meaning are called synonyms.</b></p>

<p>It is always an interesting exercise and will add greatly to your
vocabulary to select a certain paragraph and go through it replacing
certain words with other words which have practically the same meaning.
It is this mastery of synonyms which gives the great writers and
orators their power. They do not use the same word over and over
again until our ears have grown weary of it. With their wonderful
mastery of language they are never at a loss for words in which to
re-clothe their meaning.
</p>

<p>For the first three days of this week's work in spelling we have
words and their synonyms. For the words given in the lessons for the
last three days, look up in your dictionary a suitable synonym.
</p>

<p><b>Monday</b></p>

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 29</h2>


<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>The spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in any man
or woman. It is the things which we do for ourselves in any line of
work that count the most for us. The things which come to us without
any effort on our part do not stay with us very long nor do us much
good while we have them.
</p>

<p>Sometimes we feel discouraged because we have not had the opportunity
to attend school as much as we would like. There is no gainsaying
but that this is a tremendous handicap and yet, after all, it is not
an insurmountable obstacle. It is much better to have the appetite
without the food than to have the food without the appetite. There is always
a chance of securing the food if we want it bad enough and
will struggle hard enough. So in the matter of an education. Many a
man who has never seen the inside of a college is better educated than
those who have been through college.
</p>

<p>These men have really wanted knowledge, have sought it early and
late, and have found knowledge; and because they were in the work-a-day
world, in constant contact with their fellow-men, they were able to
relate the knowledge which they gained out of books to the world in
which they lived and this is true education. This is, also, what many
college-bred people lack. A student is half made as soon as he seeks
knowledge for its own sake. If you are striving to learn, not to make
grades or to pass examinations or to secure a degree, but simply for the
sake of knowing things, then indeed you are on the way to become
really educated.
</p>

<p>Stimulate within yourself a desire for knowledge, observe the things
about you, add to your store of information daily; read a good book
each day, even if you have time to read only a page or two, and you will
be surprised at the result in your life.
</p>

<p>Take, for example, our spelling. Why should we continually misspell
the words which we use every day and which we see every day on
a printed page. If we are wide-awake and have our eyes open, we can
soon learn to spell correctly all these common words, at least. Make a
list this week of fifty things with which you come in contact in your
daily work, then look these words up in your dictionary and see how
many of them you have misspelled. There is no reason why we should
not be learning constantly and the more we observe, the more acute
becomes our power of observation.
</p>

<p>Let us determine more than ever to feel that we are part of the
great world movement, that we belong in the ranks of those who have
caught the vision of what the world might be, and that we belong to
that glorious army of those who are fighting for the dream; so we
may take courage; so we may find joy in the struggle, bitter as it may
be, and so we may do our part in the fight.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_300" title="pg 300"></a>
PUNCTUATION</h3>

<p><b id="sec_490">490.</b> Marks of punctuation are very important in our written
language. They take the place of the gesture and pause and inflection
and intonation of the voice, by which we make our meaning clear in
vocal speech. So the marks of punctuation do not become mere mechanical
devices. They are marks full of meaning and necessary to express
our thought.
</p>

<p>Punctuation is a word derived from the Latin word <i>punctum</i> which
means <i>a point</i>. We have other words from the same derivation, as
puncture, etc.
</p>

<p><b>Punctuation is the art of pointing off our written language so
as to make its meaning clear.</b>
</p>

<p>Some very amusing errors have occurred because of the misplacing
or the omission of punctuation marks. It is said, that a toast was one
time given at a public dinner; "Woman! without her, man would be a
savage." The next day it appeared in print; "Woman, without her man,
would be a savage." You can readily see that the punctuation in this
instance made a very great difference in the meaning of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_491">491.</b> In conversation, the tone of the voice which we use, has a
great effect upon our meaning, for example I might say, <i>The International
failed</i>, in such a tone of voice, that it would express despair and
chagrin, and indicate that the International was a thing of the past; or I might
say, <i>The International failed</i>, with such an inflection, that you
would understand that even the suggestion was to be treated with contempt,
that the International was still powerful and its triumph inevitable.
And in writing, the only way we have of expressing these shades of
meaning is by means of punctuation marks.
</p>

<p>So these marks of punctuation are not thrown upon a page haphazardly,
or put there simply for decoration; they have a meaning and
a very great meaning. Those who use short, crisp sentences have less
need for punctuation marks than those who use longer and more involved
sentences. When we have learned to express ourselves directly and
simply, we will naturally use fewer marks of punctuation.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_492">492.</b> You will find that, in writing in connection with business,
there is much less need of punctuation than in literary and
philosophical writings. Business writing is usually direct and simple in style. Its
purpose is to state facts. The literary and philosophical writing,
however, expresses more involved ideas and emotions, and in these, the
punctuation is exceedingly important.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_493">493.</b> One of the great purposes served by punctuation is to
indicate a pause or break in the thought. A very good rule to go by in
punctuating is to repeat the sentence aloud, and whenever you pause for
breath or because of a break in the thought, it is a pretty safe
indication that in that place, you should have a punctuation mark.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_494">494.</b> The following are the chief marks of punctuation:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_301" title="pg 301"></a></p>

<h3>THE COMMA</h3>

<p><b id="sec_495">495.</b> The comma is the mark used to indicate a slight break in
the thought.
</p>

<p>There are a number of rules given for the use of commas. These
rules, like the rules for the use of capitals, you cannot commit to
memory; but, after repeated practice in your own writing and paying attention
to your reading, you will gradually develop an instinctive sense of
the use of the comma. Select some book which you are reading and go
through it, noticing especially the use of the commas. See if you can
determine the reason which prompted the author to place his commas
where he did. Notice, also, what effect the placing or the omission of
the comma would have upon the meaning of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_496">496.</b> <b>The Comma indicates the slightest degree of separation
between the parts of a sentence.</b>
</p>

<p><b>RULE 1.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_497">497.</b> <b>Words, phrases and clauses, forming a series and used in
the same construction, should be separated from each other by commas
when the conjunctions are omitted.</b></p>


<h3>WORDS WHICH FORM A SERIES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_498">498.</b> The words which form a series, separated by a comma may
be either nouns, adjectives, adverbs or verbs. The comma is only used
where the conjunction is omitted. Note carefully the following
sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Love, laughter and happiness are the right of every child.</li>

<li>He visited every city, town and village.</li>

<li>The working class has been meek, humble, docile and gullible.</li>

<li>All the crushed, tortured, strangled, maimed and murdered ideals of
the ages shall become an everlasting reality.</li>

<li>He struggled patiently, faithfully and fearlessly for the cause.</li>

<li>If labor thinks, dares, rebels, fights, it will be victorious.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_302" title="pg 302"></a>
PHRASES WHICH FORM SERIES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_499">499.</b> Phrases which are used in the same construction and form a
series are separated by commas where the conjunction is omitted. For
example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day after day, year after year, century after century, the class
struggle has proceeded.</li>

<li>The struggle in the mines, in the fields, in the factories and in the
shops, will go on until labor receives the product of its toil.</li>
</ul>


<h3>CLAUSES USED IN A SERIES</h3>

<p><b id="sec_500">500.</b> Sometimes clauses are used without the co-ordinate
conjunction and a comma is used to indicate the omission. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not moan, do not submit, do not kneel, do not pray, do not wait.</li>
<li>Speak as you mean, do as you profess, perform what you promise.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>RULE 2.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_501">501.</b> <b>Explanatory and introductory expressions, words in direct
address, parenthetical words and phrases, are separated from the
rest of the sentence by commas.</b></p>

<p>Note carefully the following examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jaures, the great French Socialist, was the first martyr to peace.</li>
<li>War having been declared, the troops were mobilized.</li>
<li>No, I cannot believe you.</li>
<li>Mr. Chairman, I desire to speak to the convention.</li>
<li>We can, of course, give you the information you desire.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>RULE 3.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_502">502.</b> <b>Words, phrases or clauses written in the sentence out of
their natural order should be separated from the rest of the sentence
by commas.</b></p>

<p>These words, phrases and clauses are often written at the beginning
of the sentences or at the end of the sentences, or in some place out of
their natural order, for the sake of emphasis, instead of with the words
they modify.</p>

<p>Notice in the following sentences how these words, phrases and
clauses are separated from the rest of the sentence by commas. Rewrite
these sentences, placing these words, phrases and clauses in their
natural order and omit the commas.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Longingly and anxiously, he waited.</li>
<li>With this exception, the figures are correct.</li>
<li>The music, sweet and dreamy, floated upon the air.</li>
<li>The waves came rolling in, white with foam.</li>
<li>To deceive the men, he resorted to shameful tricks.</li>
<li>Before anyone else could speak, he was on his feet.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_303" title="pg 303"></a>
<b>RULE 4.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_503">503.</b> <b>Co-ordinate clauses, when closely related in meaning are
separated by commas. The comma should precede the co-ordinate
conjunction.</b>  For example:
</p>

<ul><li>I have not intended to detain you, but the matter required explanation.</li></ul>


<p><b>RULE 5.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_504">504.</b> <b>The omission of the verb in a sentence or a clause should
be indicated by a comma.</b> Sometimes in writing for effect or to give
emphasis we omit the verb in the sentence; at other times we omit the
verb when the same verb occurs in a series of brief sentences, and its
continued use would mean a tiresome repetition. For example:
</p>
<ul><li>
Reading maketh a full man; conference, a ready man; writing, an
exact man.</li></ul>

<p>Here the verb is omitted in the last two clauses and the omission
is indicated by the use of the comma.
</p>

<p><b>RULE 6.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_505">505.</b> <b>Short, direct quotations should be preceded by a
comma.</b> For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their slogan is, "An injury to one is the concern of all."</li>
<li>Ferrer's last words were, "Long live the modern school."</li>
</ul>

<p><b>RULE 7.</b></p>

<p><b id="sec_506">506.</b> <b>Separate the figures in large numbers into groups of
three figures each by the use of commas.</b>  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The population of the United States has now reached 100,000,000.</li>

<li>According to the census of 1900, there are 29,073,233 people engaged
in gainful occupations in the United States.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Supply commas in the following sentences in the proper places:</p>

<ol>
<li>Food clothes and shelter are the fundamental needs of life.</li>

<li>We believe in education free from theocracy aristocracy or
plutocracy.</li>

<li>Man is the master of nature of law of life.</li>

<li>We shall struggle rebel arise and claim all being for our own.</li>

<li>Sickness and suffering sorrow and despair crime and war are
the fruits of poverty.</li>

<li>You should seek after knowledge steadily faithfully and
perseveringly.</li>

<li>The most inspiring powerful and impressive oratory is the voice
of the disinherited.</li>

<li>Through your united almighty strength order shall become
equity law shall become liberty duty shall become love and religion
shall become truth.</li>

<li>First let us consider the main question.</li>

<li>Mr. President I rise to a point of order.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" id="page_304" title="pg 304"></a>
We the workers of the world must unite.</li>

<li>The class struggle being a fact why should we hesitate to join
our class?</li>

<li>You have not it seems understood the issue.</li>

<li>Of all our needs education is the greatest.</li>

<li>Regularly and monotonously the machine whirs to and fro.</li>

<li>Before any one can take special training he must have a good
knowledge of English.</li>

<li>We plead for education universal and free.</li>

<li>The first ingredient in conversation is truth the next good sense
the third good humor and the fourth wit.</li>

<li>The slogan of the People's College is The education of the workers
by the workers.</li>

<li>According to the last census the enrollment of the schools of
the United States is 18521002.</li>

of high school.</li>
</ol>


<h3>THE SEMI-COLON</h3>

<p><b id="sec_507">507.</b> The semi-colon indicates a break more complete than that of
the comma.  The period indicates a complete break in the thought.
So the comma indicates a slight break, the semi-colon a greater break
in the thought, and the period, the completion of the thought.
</p>

<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF THE SEMI-COLON</h3>

<p><b id="sec_508">508.</b> The semi-colon is often used instead of the comma where
a longer pause is desired or we wish to indicate a greater break in the
thought. For example:
</p>
<div class="poem left">
<p>"The wind is chill;</p>
<p>But let it whistle as it will,</p>
<p>We'll keep our Christmas merry still."</p>
</div>

<p><b id="sec_509">509.</b> As a rule we separate by semi-colons those parts of the
sentences that are already punctuated by commas. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>After considerable delay, he came back to look for his friends; but,
though he looked diligently, he could not find them.</li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_510">510.</b> The semi-colon is used to separate closely connected simple
sentences when the conjunction is omitted. The continual repetition
of the conjunction would become very tiresome and detract from the
forcefulness of our sentences. So instead of continually repeating the
conjunction we separate these simple sentences by semi-colons. For
example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Through the industrial revolution, the face of the earth is making over
even as to its physical forms; political boundaries are wiped out and
moved about as if they were indeed only lines on a paper map; population is
hurriedly gathered into cities from the ends of the earth; habits of living are
altered with startling abruptness; the search for the truths of nature
is infinitely stimulated; and the application of these truths to life is made not only
practicable, but commercially necessary.
</p></blockquote>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_305" title="pg 305"></a>
<b id="sec_511">511.</b> The semi-colon should be used after each item in a series of
specific statements. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>We quote you the following prices: Grade No. 1, $1.00; Grade No. 2,
$2.90; poorer grades not in demand.</li></ul>



<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF THE COLON</h3>

<p><b id="sec_512">512.</b> The colon is not used as much as it formerly was. The comma
and the semi-colon and the period are now used in most of the places
where older writers used the colon.
</p>

<p>One authority in English says that, "in strict logic the colon is to
the sentence in which it is used what the mark of equality is in
mathematics."
</p>

<p><b id="sec_513">513.</b> The colon is used before a formal list of items. For
example:
</p>


<ul><li>Economics has three important divisions: production, distribution,
consumption.</li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_514">514.</b> The colon is used after a salutation at the beginning of a
letter. For example: <i>Dear Sir:</i> <i>Gentlemen:</i> <i>Comrades:</i>
</p>

<p>In such cases the dash is also frequently used with the colon. For
example: <i>My dear Sir:&mdash;</i> <i>Gentlemen:&mdash;</i>
<i>Comrades:&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_515">515.</b> The colon is more often used instead of the semi-colon after
such expressions as, <i>thus:</i> <i>as follows:</i> <i>the
following:</i> <i>for example:</i> etc.
</p>

<p>The colon is also used to separate a series of sentences which are
explanatory of the main clause. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The People's College has two great aims: the first is to bring education
within the reach of every worker; the second is to teach from the
viewpoint of the working class.</li>

<li>We were advised to proceed thus: first, to be systematic in our work;
second, to concentrate; third, to go slowly and surely; and last of all,
to think for ourselves.</li>
</ul>


<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF THE PERIOD</h3>

<p><b id="sec_516">516.</b> <b>The period is a mark of punctuation that denotes the
completion of a sentence.</b>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_517">517.</b> The period is used at the close of all assertive and
imperative sentences. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is talk of peace but preparation for war.</li>
<li>Claim your own at any hazard.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_518">518.</b> The period is used after all initials and all abbreviations,
as for example: E. V. Debs; T. P. O'Connor; Mr., Dr., Co., Mass., N. Y.,
C. O. D., F. O. B., U. S. A., etc.</p>

<p><b id="sec_519">519.</b> The period is used to separate whole numbers and decimal
numbers. For example: 3.1416 9.342.</p>

<p>A period is used for the decimal point between dollars and cents;
as: $4.50, $2.25, $16.54, $35926.72.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_306" title="pg 306"></a>
It is also used to separate the various denominations of sterling
money, as: £14. 15s. 6d.</p>

<p><b id="sec_520">520.</b> The period is used after letters used as numerals or after
figures used to number paragraphs, notes, remarks, questions or any
list of particulars. For example:</p>

<p>The letters which are used to denote sub-heads in the enumeration
of rules as <i>a. b. c.</i>, etc., also the numerals and letters marking
sections or sub-sections in chapters, as <i>Chapter 8.</i> <i>Paragraph 1.</i>
<i>Rule 1.</i> <i>Page 4.</i> <i>Volume 2.</i> <i>Paragraph 3.</i> <i>P. 16.</i>
</p>

<p><b id="sec_521">521.</b> The period is also used after headings and titles, after
dates and signatures to letters and other documents; also at the close of the
address at the beginning of a letter, and of the name at the close of
the letter; also after the last item in the direction of an envelope or
package.
</p>

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>In the following quotations place the commas, semi-colons, colons
and periods in their proper places, and be able to give a reason for
what you do:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man who stabs his brother to death is a criminal and is hanged the
general who under a flag slays a regiment is a hero and is decorated
with a cross</p>

<p>The most thrilling oratory the most powerful and impressive eloquence is
the voice of the disinherited the oppressed the suffering and the
submerged it is the voice of poverty and misery of wretchedness and despair it is the
voice of humanity crying to the infinite it is the voice that resounds
throughout the earth and reaches heaven it is the voice that wakens the conscience of
the race and proclaims the truths that fill the world with life liberty and love</p>

<p>The number of lives lost in the great wars of the world have been as
follows Napoleonic wars 1900000 our Civil War 656000 Franco-German War
290000 Boer War 90898 Russo-Japanese 555900 and in the present world-war
untold millions</p>

<p>Walt Whitman who represents individualism at its best writes "I sing the
song of myself" To this the Socialist replies "Inasmuch as my redemption
is bound up in that of my class I sing the song of my class"</p>

<p>We believe with John Ruskin "whether there be one God or three no God
or ten thousand children should be fed and their bodies should be kept
clean"</p>

<p>My dear Mr Smith Your letter of the 15th has been received</p>

<p>Through the dreams of all the ages rings the voice of labor beginning as
a murmur growing in volume and grandeur as it rolls round the world And
this is the burden of its message By the sweat of no other's brow shalt
thou eat bread</p>

<p>The sun of the new world is rising it is rising out of the solidarity of
the working class Its rays of light are bursting through the dark
horizon which ignorance and deceit have so long riveted upon us It is lighting
up the faces of a new order of men and women supermen and women men and women
not discouraged by defeat god-like men and women who have found the
secret springs of life and are already drinking deep and glorious draughts men
and women who are standing erect and whose joined hands encircle the world
men and women who see the world's wretchedness and the world's poverty and
are ready to throw away their lives with a song on their lips that such
things shall not be</p>

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 29</h2>

<p>Last week we studied words which had the same, or nearly the
same, meaning. There is always a slight distinction in the meaning of
words, but some of them are so nearly the same that it makes very little
difference which word we use. Some writers, however, are very careful
and spend a great deal of time in the selection of just the right word
to express their meaning.
</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson once said a good writer would wait half a
day in order to secure the best word to convey a certain idea.
</p>

<p>A very amusing story is told of Thomas Carlyle, who was very
careful to use words expressing just the shade of meaning which he
desired to express. He had a habit of writing in a note book these words
as they occurred to him, so he would have them for ready reference
and use. One day he had searched all day for a certain word which
eluded him. Suddenly in the middle of the night he wakened with the
word flashing in his mind. He wanted to write it down immediately
lest he should forget it in the morning, but it was cold and he dreaded
getting up in the cold to secure his note book so he nudged Jeanie, his
wife, and said: "Jeanie, Jeanie, get up! I have thought of a good word,
and I want you to write it down." Now it was equally cold for Jeanie,
so Jeanie nudged Thomas and said: "Thomas, Thomas, get up yourself.
I have thought of a bad one!"
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is a good idea when these good words occur to you
to write them down. Possibly to save trouble, you had better write
them for yourself!
</p>

<p>But in addition to words which have the same meaning, or almost
the same meaning, there are also words which express just the opposite
meaning, and it is well for us to be master of these words also.
</p>

<p><b>These words which express opposite meaning are called
antonyms.</b> Words and their antonyms are given in this week's spelling
lesson in the words for the first three days' study. For the last three
days, words only are given. Look these words up in your dictionary
and determine upon the most suitable antonyms.

who has accused another of being a "high-brow" has by that very act,
admitted his own inferiority.

PLAIN ENGLISH</h2>

<h2>LESSON 30</h2>

<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

<p>With this lesson we are finishing this course in Plain English.
We have covered a great deal of ground and have studied the essentials
of grammar. We have tried, as far as possible, to avoid the stupid
conning of rules or learning by rote. We have attempted at least to
make the reason and necessity for every rule apparent before the rule
was stated.
</p>

<p>We have also tried to weave into the lessons something of the romance
of language, for language is a romance; in its growth is written
the epic of the race. Our words portray the struggle of man from
savage to sage. So, feeble as our efforts in this regard may have been,
we trust that you have enjoyed and profited by this course and have
caught a new vision of life. Most of us are forced so inexorably into
the bitter struggle for existence that we have little time or
opportunity to catch much of the beauty of life. That is the curse of a society that
dooms its citizens to weary, toil-burdened lives, robbed of the joy and
beauty of living.
</p>

<p>Yet, if we know how to read we can always have access to books
and through them we can escape the sordidness and ugliness of the life
in which we are compelled to live and spend at least a little time each
day in the company of great souls who speak to us from the printed page.
The quotations in these lessons have been taken from these great
writers.
</p>

<p>Will you not pursue the acquaintanceship and become real friends
with these men and women? Above all things they will bring you into
the atmosphere of liberty and of freedom. For throughout all the
pain of the struggle of the past and of the present, there has been the
fight of man for freedom. We have gained the mastery over nature.
Wild animals, which were a constant menace to savage man, have been
destroyed. We have been freed from fear and superstition by the
discovery of the laws of nature. With the invention of the machine, man
has increased his ability to provide the essentials of life,&mdash;food,
clothing and shelter&mdash;a thousandfold. The past has seen revolution after
revolution in the struggle for mastery.
</p>

<p>We now stand on the threshold of another great revolution when
man shall master the machines which he has invented and shall cease
serving them and make them serve him. His increased facilities for
food-getting and shelter-getting shall be made to serve all mankind.
We have a part to play in that great revolution.
</p>

<p>Whatever you may have gained from the study of this course;
what increased facility of understanding or of expression may have
come to you; may it be not only for the service of yourself but also for
the service of the revolution that shall bring the worker into his own.
</p>

THE ETERNAL WHY</h3>

<p><b id="sec_522">522.</b> There is no more important mark of punctuation than the
Interrogation Point. Asking questions is the foundation and beginning
of all wisdom. Progress is based upon the eternal <i>Why</i>. If men had
always been satisfied with the knowledge of their age and had not
continually asked questions which they set themselves to answer, we would
still be living in caves or dwelling in trees.
</p>

<p>The natural child, that is, the child whose will has not been broken,
is an animated Interrogation Point. He is full of questions. He wants
to know <i>why</i> this and <i>why</i> that. This is a most natural
trait and one that should not be destroyed. It may sadly interfere sometimes with
the things that we wish to do, to stop and answer the child's questions
as to why cats have tails or who made the world and what did he stand
on while he was doing it; but it is decidedly important that some one
should answer these questions which the child asks, in a manner to
satisfy its present craving for knowledge. The fact that this trait has been
quenched in so many children by the impatient grown-ups explains their
stupidity in later years. Encourage every child to ask questions.
Encourage it also to be persistent until it finds somewhere the answer to its
questions.
</p>

<p>Cultivate also this trait yourself. Do not accept a thing simply
because some one says it is so. Insist upon knowing for yourself. This
is the secret of progress, that we should think for ourselves,
investigate for ourselves and not fear to face the facts of life or to express our
own ideas. The wise man does not accept a thing because it is old nor does
he reject it because it is new. He inquires, demands, reasons and
satisfies himself as to the merit of the question. So the Interrogation Point
in the written language of man has a tremendous meaning. It stands for
the open and inquiring mind; for the courage that dares question all
things and seek the truth.
</p>

<h3>THE INTERROGATION POINT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_523">523.</b> An Interrogation Point should be placed after every direct
question.</p>

<p>A direct question is one that can be answered. An indirect question
is one that cannot be answered. If I say, <i>Why do you not study?</i>,
I am asking a direct question to which you can give an answer; but if I say,
<i>I wonder why you do not study</i>, I have asked an indirect question
which does not require a direct answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you not go?  (<i>Direct</i>)</li>
<li>He asked why you did not go. (<i>Indirect</i>)</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_524">524.</b> When an interrogative clause is repeated in the body of
another sentence, use the interrogation point after the clause, and
begin the clause with a capital letter. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>
The question, <i>Shall we be involved in war?</i>, should be settled by
the people.</li></ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_312" title="pg 312"></a>
THE EXCLAMATION POINT</h3>

<p><b id="sec_525">525.</b> The exclamation point should be placed after words, phrases
or sentences that express strong emotion. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh! When shall peace reign again?</li>
<li>Alas! I am undone!</li>
<li>To the firing line! the battle rages!</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_526">526.</b> Ordinarily the exclamation point is placed immediately after
the interjection or word used as an interjection, but frequently when
the strong emotion continues throughout the expression, the exclamation
point is placed at the close of the sentence instead of after the
interjection, even though the interjection comes first in the sentence. For
example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>On, Comrades, on!</li>
<li>Charge, Chester, charge!</li>
</ul>


<h3>THE DASH</h3>

<p><b id="sec_527">527.</b> The dash is a much abused punctuation mark. A great many
writers who are not familiar with the rules of punctuation use a dash
whenever they feel the need of some sort of a punctuation mark. Their
rule seems to be, "whenever you pause make a dash." Punctuation
marks indicate pauses but a dash should not be used upon every occasion.
The dash should not be used as a substitute for the comma, semi-colon,
colon, etc. In reality, the dash should be used only when these marks
cannot be correctly used.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_528">528.</b> The chief use of the dash is to indicate a sudden break in
the thought or a sudden change in the construction of the sentence.
For example:
</p>

<ul><li>
In the next place&mdash;but I cannot discuss the matter further under
the circumstances.</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_529">529.</b> The dash is frequently used to set a parenthetical
expression off from the rest of the sentence when it has not as close connection
with the sentence as would be indicated by commas. As for example:
</p>

<ul><li>
The contention may be true&mdash;although I do not believe it&mdash;that this
sort of training is necessary.</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_530">530.</b> The dash is also used in place of commas to denote a longer
or more expressive pause. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>The man sank&mdash;then rose&mdash;then sank again.</li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_531">531.</b> The dash <span class="corr" title="if">is</span> often used after an enumeration of
several items as a summing up. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>Production, distribution, consumption&mdash;all are a part of economics.</li></ul>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_313" title="pg 313"></a>
<b id="sec_532">532.</b> A dash is often used when a word or phrase is repeated for
emphasis. For example:</p>

<ul><li>Is there universal education&mdash;education for every child beneath the
flag? It is not for the masses of the children&mdash;not for the children of
the masses.</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_533">533.</b> If the parenthetical statements within dashes require
punctuation marks, this mark should be placed before the second dash. For
example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>War for defense&mdash;and was there ever a war that was not for defense?&mdash;was
permitted by the International.</li>
<li>This sight&mdash;what a wonderful sight it was!&mdash;greeted our eyes with the dawn.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_534">534.</b> The dash is also used to indicate the omission of a word,
especially such words as <i>as</i>, <i>namely</i>, <i>viz.</i>, etc. For
example:
</p>

<ul><li>Society is divided into two classes&mdash;the exploited and the exploiting classes.</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_535">535.</b> After a quotation, use the dash before the name of the
author. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>Life only avails, not the having lived.&mdash;<i>Emerson.</i></li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_536">536.</b> The dash is used to mark the omission of letters or figures.
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>It happened in the city of M&mdash;.</li>
<li>It was in the year 18&mdash;.</li>
</ul>


<h3>PARENTHESIS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_537">537.</b> In our study of the comma and the dash we have found that
parenthetical statements are set off from the rest of the sentence
sometimes by a comma and sometimes by a dash. When the connection
with the rest of the sentence is close, and yet the words are thrown in
in a parenthetical way, commas are used to separate the parenthetical
statement from the rest of the sentence.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_538">538.</b> When the connection is not quite so close, the dash is used
instead of the comma to indicate the fact that this statement is thrown
in by way of explanation or additional statement. But when we use
explanatory words or parenthetical statements that have little or no
connection with the rest of the sentence, these phrases or clauses are
separated from the rest of the sentences by the parenthesis.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_539">539.</b> <b>GENERAL RULE:&mdash;Marks of parenthesis are used to
set off expressions that have no vital connection with the rest of
the sentence.</b> For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorance (and why should we hesitate to acknowledge it?) keeps us enslaved.</li>
<li>Education (and this is a point that needs continual emphasis) is the foundation of all progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_314" title="pg 314"></a>
THE PUNCTUATION OF THE PARENTHESIS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_540">540.</b> If the parenthetical statement asks a question or voices an
exclamation, it should be followed by the interrogation point or the
exclamation point, within the parenthesis. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We are all of us (who can deny it?) partial to our own failings.</li>

<li>The lecturer (and what a marvelous orator he is!) held the audience
spellbound for hours.</li>
</ul>


<h3>OTHER USES OF THE PARENTHESIS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_541">541.</b> An Interrogation Point is oftentimes placed within a
parenthesis in the body of a sentence to express doubt or uncertainty as to
the accuracy of our statement. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1858 (?) this great movement was started.</li>
<li>John (?) Smith was the next witness.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_542">542.</b> The parenthesis is used to include numerals or letters in
the enumeration of particulars. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Economics deals with (1) production, (2) distribution, (3) consumption.</li>
<li>There are three sub-heads; (a) grammar, (b) rhetoric, (c) composition.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_543">543.</b> Marks of parenthesis are used to inclose an
amount or number written in figures when it is also written in words, as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We will need forty (40) machines in addition to those we now have.</li>
<li>Enclosed find Forty Dollars ($40.00) to apply on account.</li>
</ul>


<h3>THE BRACKET</h3>

<p><b id="sec_544">544.</b> The bracket [&nbsp;] indicates that the word or words included in
the bracket are not in the original discourse.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_545">545.</b> The bracket is generally used by editors in supplying
missing words, dates and the like, and for corrections, additions and
explanations. For example:
</p>
<ul><li>
This rule usually applies though there are some exceptions. [See
Note 3, Rule 1, Page 67].
</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_546">546.</b> All interpretations, notes, corrections and explanations,
which introduce words or phrases not used by the author himself, should be
enclosed in brackets.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_547">547.</b> Brackets are also used for a parenthesis within a
parenthesis. If we wish to introduce a parenthetical statement within a parenthetical
statement this should be enclosed in a bracket. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He admits that this fact (the same fact which the previous witness
[Mr. James E. Smith] had denied) was only partially true.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_315" title="pg 315"></a>
QUOTATION MARKS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_548">548.</b> Quotation marks are used to show that the words enclosed
by them are the exact words of the writer or speaker.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_549">549.</b> A direct quotation is always enclosed in quotation marks.
For example:
</p>

<ul><li>He remarked, "I believe it to be true."</li></ul>

<p>But an indirect quotation is not enclosed in quotation marks. For example:</p>

<ul><li>He remarked that he believed it was true.</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_550">550.</b> When the name of an author is given at the close of a
quotation it is not necessary to use the quotation marks. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>All courage comes from braving the unequal.&mdash;<i>Eugene F. Ware.</i></li></ul>

<p>When the name of the author precedes the quotation, the marks
are used, as in the following:</p>

<ul><li>It was Eugene F. Ware who said, "Men are not great except they do
and dare."</li></ul>

<p><b id="sec_551">551.</b> When we are referring to titles of books, magazines or
newspapers, or words and phrases used in illustration, we enclose them in
quotation marks, unless they are written in italics. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>"Whitman's Leaves of Grass" or <i>Whitman's Leaves of Grass</i>. "The
New York Call" or <i>The New York Call</i>. The word "book" is a noun,
or, The word <i>book</i> is a noun.</li></ul>

<h3>THE QUOTATION WITHIN A QUOTATION</h3>

<p><b id="sec_552">552.</b> When a quotation is contained within another, the included
quotation should be enclosed by single quotation marks and the entire
quotation enclosed by the usual marks. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He began by saying, "The last words of Ferrer, 'Long live the modern
school' might serve as the text for this lecture."</li>

<li>The speaker replied, "It was Karl Marx who said, 'Government always
belongs to those who control the wealth of the country.'"</li>
</ul>

<p>You will note in this sentence that the quotation within the quotation
occurs at the end of the sentence so there are three apostrophes
used after it, the single apostrophe to indicate the included quotation
and the double apostrophe which follows the entire quotation.
</p>

<h3>PUNCTUATION WITH QUOTATION MARKS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_553">553.</b> Marks of punctuation are (except the interrogation point and
the exclamation point which are explained later) placed inside the
quotation marks. For example:
</p>

<ul><li>A wise man said, "Know thyself."</li></ul>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_316" title="pg 316"></a>
Notice that the period is placed after the word <i>thyself</i> and is
followed by the quotation marks.
</p>

<ul><li>"We can easily rout the enemy," declared the speaker.</li></ul>

<p>Notice that the comma is placed after <i>enemy</i>, and before the
quotation marks.</p>

<p><b id="sec_554">554.</b> The Interrogation Point and the Exclamation Point are placed
within the quotation marks if they refer <i>only</i> to the words
quoted, but if they belong to the entire sentence they should be placed outside the
quotation marks. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He said, "Will you come now?"</li>
<li>Did he say, "Will you come now"?</li>
<li>He said, "What a beautiful night!"</li>
<li>How wonderfully inspiring is Walt Whitman's poem, "The Song of the Open Road"!</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_555">555.</b> Sometimes parenthetical or explanatory words are inserted
within a quotation. These words should be set off by commas, and both
parts of the quotation enclosed in quotation marks. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"I am aware," he said, "that you do not agree with me."</li>
<li>"But why," the speaker was asked, "should you make such a statement?"</li>
<li>"I do not believe," he replied, "that you have understood me."</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE APOSTROPHE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_556">556.</b> The apostrophe is used to indicate the omission of letters
or syllables, as: <i>He doesn't</i>, instead of <i>does not</i>;
<i>We're</i>, instead of <i>we are</i>;
<i>I'm</i>, instead of <i>I am</i>; <i> it's</i>, instead of <i>it
is</i>; <i>ne'er</i>, instead of <i>never</i>; <i>they'll</i>,
instead of <i>they will</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_557">557.</b> The apostrophe is also used to denote possession. In the single
form of the nouns it precedes the <i>s</i>. In the plural form of nouns ending
in <i>s</i> it follows the <i>s</i>. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy's, man's, girl's, king's, friend's, etc.</li>
<li>Boys', men's, girls', kings', friends', etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the apostrophe is not used with the possessive pronouns
<i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>theirs</i>, <i>hers</i>.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_558">558.</b> The apostrophe is used to indicate the plural of letters,
figures or signs. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dot your <i>i's</i> and cross your <i>t's</i>.</li>
<li>He seems unable to learn the table of 8's and 9's.</li>
<li>Do not make your <i>n's</i> and <i>u's</i> so much alike.</li>
</ul>

<p><b id="sec_559">559.</b> The apostrophe is used to mark the omission of the century
in dates, as: '87 instead of 1887, '15 instead of 1915.
</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page_317" title="pg 317"></a>
THE HYPHEN</h3>

<p><b id="sec_560">560.</b> The hyphen is used between the parts of a compound word
or at the end of a line to indicate that a word is divided. We have
so many compound words in our language which we have used so often
that we have almost forgotten that they were compound words so it is
not always easy to decide whether the hyphen belongs in a word or not.
As, for example; we find such words as <i>schoolhouse</i>,
<i>bookkeeper</i>, <i>railway</i>
and many others which are, in reality, compound words and in the
beginning were written with the hyphen. We have used them so frequently
and their use as compound words has become so commonplace,
that we no longer use the hyphen in writing them. Yet frequently you
will find them written with the hyphen by some careful writer.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_561">561.</b> As a general rule the parts of all words which are made by
uniting two or more words into one should be joined by hyphens, as:
</p>

<ul><li>Men-of-war, knee-deep, half-hearted, full-grown, mother-in-law, etc.</li></ul>


<p><b id="sec_562">562.</b> The numerals expressing a compound number should be
united by a hyphen, as; <i>forty-two</i>, <i>twenty-seven</i>, <i>thirty-nine</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_563">563.</b> When the word <i>self</i> is used with an adverb, a noun or an adjective,
it is always connected by the hyphen, as; <i>self-confidence</i>, <i>self-confident</i>,
<i>self-confidently</i>, <i>self-command</i>, <i>self-assertive</i>, <i>self-asserting</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_564">564.</b> When the word <i>fold</i> is added to a number of more than one
syllable, the hyphen is always used, as; <i>thirty-fold</i>, <i>forty-fold</i>, <i>fifty-fold</i>,
etc. If the numeral has but one syllable, do not use the hyphen, as; <i>twofold</i>, <i>threefold</i>, <i>fourfold</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_565">565.</b> When fractions are written in words instead of figures always
use the hyphen, as; <i>one-half</i>, <i>one-fourth</i>, <i>three-sevenths</i>, <i>nine-twelfths</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_566">566.</b> The words <i>half</i> and <i>quarter</i>, when used with any word, should
be connected by a hyphen, as; <i>half-dollar</i>, <i>quarter-pound</i>, <i>half-skilled</i>,
<i>half-barbaric</i>, <i>half-civilized</i>, <i>half-dead</i>, <i>half-spent</i>, etc.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_567">567.</b> Sometimes we coin a phrase for temporary use in which the
words are connected by the hyphen. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a never-to-be-forgotten day.</li>
<li>He wore a sort of I-told-you-so air.</li>
<li>They were fresh-from-the-pen copies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ADDITIONAL MARKS OF PUNCTUATION</h3>

<p>There are a few other marks of punctuation which we do not often
use in writing but which we find on the printed page. It is well for us
to know the meaning of these marks.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_568">568.</b> The caret (<span class="sub">^</span>) is used to mark the omission of a letter or
word or a number of words. The omitted part is generally written
above, and the caret shows where it should be inserted. For example:
</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_318" title="pg 318"></a></p>
<ul>
<li style=" text-indent: 9em; ">s</li>
<li>I cannot give you this permis<span class="sub">^</span>ion.</li>
<li style=" text-indent: 2em; ">received</li>
<li>I have just <span class="sub">^</span>a letter from him.</li>
<li style=" text-indent: 20em; ">and all letters</li>
<li>Please write your matriculation number on all examination papers <span class="sub">^</span>sent in to the College.</li>

</ul>

<p>The above examples illustrate the use of the caret with the omission
of a letter, a word or phrase.
</p>

<p><b id="sec_569">569.</b> If a letter or manuscript is not too long, it should always
be rewritten and the omissions properly inserted. Occasionally, however,
we are in a hurry and our time is too limited to rewrite an entire
letter because of the omission of a single letter or word so we can insert it
by the use of the caret. If, however, there are many mistakes, the letter
or paper should be rewritten, for the too frequent use of the caret
indicates carelessness in writing and does not produce a favorable
impression upon the recipient of your letter or manuscript.
</p>

<h3>MARKS OF ELLIPSIS</h3>

<p><b id="sec_570">570.</b> Sometimes a long dash (&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;) or
succession of asterisks (* * * * * *) or of points (. . . . . .) is
used to indicate the omission of a portion of a sentence or a discourse. In printed
matter usually the asterisks are used to indicate an omission. In typewritten
matter usually a succession of points is used to indicate an omission.
In writing, these are difficult to make and the omission of the portion
of material is usually indicated by a succession of short dashes (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
&mdash;).
</p>

<h3>MARKS OF REFERENCE</h3>

<p><b id="sec_571">571.</b> On the printed page you will often find the asterisk (*), or
the dagger, (&dagger;), the section (§), or
parallel lines (||), used to call your attention to some note or remark written at the close of the paragraph
or on the margin, at the bottom of the page or the end of the chapter.
It is advisable to hunt these up as soon as you come to the mark which
indicates their presence, for they usually contain some matter which
explains or adds to the meaning of the sentence which you have just
finished reading.
</p>

<p>In the following exercise, note the various marks of punctuation and
determine why each one is used:</p>
<div class="poem med">

SPELLING</h2>

<h2>LESSON 30</h2>

<p>There are a great many words in English which are frequently mispronounced;
the accent is placed upon the wrong syllable; for example,
<i>thea'ter</i> instead of <i>the'ater</i>; the wrong sound is given to
the vowel, for example, <i>hearth</i> is pronounced <i>hurth</i>. Sometimes, too, an
extra letter is added in the pronunciation; for example, <i>once</i> is often
pronounced as though it were spelled <i>wunst</i>.
</p>

<p>The following is a list of common words that are frequently
mispronounced, and there are many others which you may add to this list
as they occur to you. Look up the correct pronunciation in the
dictionary and pronounce them many times aloud.
</p>

<p>In the second column in this list is given the incorrect pronunciation,
which we often hear.

<p>There are a number of words in English which sound very much
alike and which we are apt to confuse. For example, I heard a man
recently say in a speech that the party to which he belonged had taken
slow poison and now needed an anecdote. It is presumed that he meant
that it needed an antidote. Some one else remarked that a certain
individual had not been expelled but simply expended. He undoubtedly
meant that the individual had been suspended.
</p>

<p>This confusion in the use of words detracts from the influence
which our statements would otherwise have. There are a number of
words which are so nearly alike that it is very easy to be confused in
the use of them. In our spelling lesson for this week we have a number of
the most common of these easily confounded words. Add to the list as
many others as you can.

<h3>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</h3>

<p>As we look back over the study of these thirty lessons we find that
we have covered quite a little ground. We have covered the entire field
of English grammar including punctuation. But our study of English
must not conclude with the study of this course. This is simply the
foundation which we have laid for future work. You know when
students graduate from high school or college the graduation is called
the Commencement. That is a peculiarly fitting term, for the gaining
of knowledge ought truly to be the commencement of life for us.
</p>

<p>Some one has said that the pursuit of knowledge might be compared
to a man's marriage to a charming, wealthy woman. He pursued and
married her because of her wealth but after marriage found her so
charming that he grew to love her for herself. So we ofttimes pursue
wisdom for practical reasons because we expect it to serve us in the
matter of making a living; because we expect it to make us more
efficient workers; to increase our efficiency to such an extent that we may
command a higher salary, enter a better profession and be more certain
of a job.
</p>

<p>All this is well; but we often find that after we have pursued wisdom
for these reasons, practical as they are, we have fallen in love with
her for her own sake. We begin to take pleasure in her society; we
begin to want to know things for the sake of knowing them, for the
pleasure that it brings us, quite divorced from any idea of monetary
gain.
</p>

<p>So while we have urged upon you the study of English because of
the great practical benefit that it will be to you, we trust that you
have also grown to love the study for its own sake.
</p>

<p>Make this but the beginning of your work in the study of English.</p>
